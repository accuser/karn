# Bynk

**Bynk** is a statically typed, *architecture-first* programming language for
building services. The shape of a program — its contexts, services, agents, and
the types that flow between them — is part of the language, not a convention
layered on top. Bynk compiles to **typed TypeScript** and targets **Cloudflare
Workers**.

> ⚠️ Bynk is **pre-1.0 and under active development.** The language evolves in
> small, spec-first increments. The [Bynk Book](docs/) documents *what compiles
> today*; planned features are marked as planned.

## The idea in one example

```bynk
context greet

service api {
  on http GET "/ping" () -> Effect[HttpResult[String]] {
    Ok("pong")
  }
}
```

Compiling this with `bynkc` produces TypeScript you can read, run, and deploy —
the router, boundary validation, and the Worker entry point are generated for
you.

## What makes Bynk distinct

- **Make illegal states unrepresentable.** *Refined types* (types carrying a
  predicate), *opaque types*, and errors-as-values (`Result`, `Ok`/`Some`/
  `None`) let whole classes of bug go unexpressed.
- **Architecture in the language.** Contexts, services, and stateful *agents*
  are first-class, and a `context` is the unit of deployment — it becomes one
  Cloudflare Worker.
- **Honest effects and capabilities.** Dependencies are declared in signatures
  (`given Logger`), supplied by the platform, and mockable in tests.
- **Compiles to TypeScript.** You get JavaScript-ecosystem interop and a natural
  fit for Cloudflare Workers, with a static type system in front of it.
- **Testing is built in.** `test` blocks, `assert`, dependency `mocks`, and
  `Mock[T]` value fabrication ship with the language.

## Install

Bynk is not yet on a package registry for end users; install it by building from
source with a recent Rust toolchain (stable, 2024 edition — see
[rustup](https://rustup.rs/)).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/accuser/bynk.git
cd bynk
cargo install --path bynkc      # the `bynkc` compiler
cargo install --path bynk       # the `bynk` driver (doctor / new / dev)
cargo install --path bynk-lsp   # optional: the `bynkc-lsp` language server
```

`bynkc --help` lists the four compiler commands (`compile`, `check`, `fmt`,
`test`); `bynk --help` lists the driver's (`doctor`, `new`, `dev`).

## Quick start

Scaffold a complete, runnable project and serve it — three commands from nothing
to a running service on `http://localhost:8787`:

```sh
bynk new hello       # scaffold bynk.toml + src/hello.bynk
cd hello
bynk dev             # compile and serve it locally
```

`bynk new` only writes files (no toolchain needed), and `bynk dev` serves what it
wrote unmodified. Prefer a worked example? The bundled
[`examples/hello-world`](examples/hello-world/) is a complete project you can also
`bynkc check src`, `bynkc test .`, and deploy.

See [Start a new project](https://bynk-lang.org/book/guides/projects-build-and-deployment/start-a-project/)
or [Compile your first program](https://bynk-lang.org/book/tutorials/01-first-program/).

## Documentation

The **[Bynk Book](https://bynk-lang.org/book/)** is the canonical guide and
reference. It follows [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/), grouped concern-first so
each topic keeps its explanation, recipes, and reference together:

- **[Tutorials](https://bynk-lang.org/book/tutorials/01-first-program/)** — learn Bynk by building.
- **[Guides](https://bynk-lang.org/book/guides/)** — task-focused recipes, each section
  opening with the *why* before the *how*.
- **[Reference](https://bynk-lang.org/book/reference/)** — exact behaviour, including the
  [normative spec](https://bynk-lang.org/book/spec/) and [CLI reference](https://bynk-lang.org/book/reference/cli/).

The Book's source lives in [`site/`](site/). Build it locally with
[Astro](https://astro.build/): `cd site && npm install && npm run dev`.

## Status

Bynk is pre-1.0. Some designed features (events, sagas, storage kinds) are
**deferred, not missing**, and land in later increments. See the
[status and roadmap](design/bynk-status-and-roadmap.md).
