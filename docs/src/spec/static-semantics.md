# §5 Static semantics

A program that parses ([§3](lexical-grammar.md), [§4](syntactic-grammar.md)) is
not yet known to be well-formed. This chapter states the **well-formedness
rules**: the conditions a program MUST satisfy beyond parsing, each tied to the
`karn.*` diagnostic a conforming implementation emits when the rule is violated
([§1.3](scope.md)). A program is well-formed exactly when it provokes no such
diagnostic.

> [!NOTE]
> Lexical and grammatical errors — the `karn.lex.*` and `karn.parse.*` codes —
> are *syntactic*: they report a text that does not match the grammar, and are
> governed by §3 and §4. This chapter covers only **post-syntactic**
> well-formedness. This note is informative.

The rules are organised by theme. Each theme states its load-bearing rules and
cites the governing codes; the **exhaustive** code-by-code catalogue is the
[diagnostic index](../reference/diagnostics.md) (and §9). Where a theme maps to a
single construct, its full set of governing diagnostics is surfaced inline with
`{{#grammar-semantics}}`.

## §5.1 Name resolution & visibility

Every referenced name MUST resolve to a declaration in scope
(`karn.resolve.unknown_name`, `karn.resolve.unknown_type`,
`karn.resolve.unknown_function`, `karn.resolve.unknown_field`). A name used where
a value is expected MUST denote a value, not a type (`karn.resolve.type_in_expr`,
`karn.resolve.type_as_function`); a function MUST be called, not referenced bare
(`karn.resolve.fn_without_call`).

Within a scope, names MUST be unique: duplicate types, functions, methods,
services, capabilities, providers, agents, record fields, variants, and
parameters are each rejected (the `karn.resolve.duplicate_*` codes). A `let`
binding MUST NOT shadow a function or a type (`karn.resolve.let_shadows_fn`,
`karn.resolve.let_shadows_type`).

A `commons` is imported with `uses`, which MUST name an existing `commons`, not a
context, and MUST NOT be self-referential or introduce a colliding name
(`karn.uses.unknown_commons`, `karn.uses.target_is_context`,
`karn.uses.self_reference`, `karn.uses.name_conflict`). The visibility of types
across context boundaries is governed by `exports` and `consumes`
([§5.8](#58-boundaries--cross-context)).

## §5.2 Well-typedness

Every expression MUST have the type its position requires. A function or method
argument MUST match the parameter type (`karn.types.argument_mismatch`), and a
call MUST supply the right number of arguments (`karn.resolve.arity_mismatch`,
`karn.types.method_arity`). A returned value MUST match the declared return type
(`karn.types.return_mismatch`); a `let` value MUST match any annotation
(`karn.types.let_annotation_mismatch`); a record field MUST be given a value of
its type (`karn.types.field_value_mismatch`), and every required field MUST be
supplied (`karn.resolve.missing_field`).

An `if` condition MUST be a `Bool` and both branches MUST share a type
(`karn.types.if_non_bool_cond`, `karn.types.if_branch_mismatch`). The payloads of
`Ok`, `Err`, `Some`, and the like MUST match the expected component type (the
`karn.types.*_value_mismatch` codes). Where a constructor is ambiguous between
`Result` and `HttpResult`, it MUST be qualified (`karn.types.ambiguous_constructor`).

{{#grammar-semantics if_expr}}

## §5.3 Refinement & admission

A refinement's predicates MUST apply to the type's base — a string predicate on
an `Int` is rejected (`karn.types.predicate_base_mismatch`) — and MUST be
internally consistent: an `InRange` MUST NOT be inverted
(`karn.types.inverted_range`), a length MUST NOT be negative
(`karn.types.negative_length`), a `Matches` regex MUST be valid
(`karn.types.invalid_regex`), and the predicates together MUST admit at least one
value (`karn.types.empty_refinement`).

A **literal** written where a refined type is expected is admitted at compile
time ([§6.4](type-system.md#64-admission--construction)) in these positions:
return (block tail), a `let` with a type annotation, an `Ok`/`Some`/`Err`
payload, and a refined-typed call argument. The literal MUST satisfy the
predicate, or it is rejected (`karn.refine.literal_violates`); an admitted
literal MUST be a compile-time literal, not an expression or identifier. **Opaque
types are excluded** from admission and MUST be constructed through `.of`,
`.unsafe`, or `.raw`, never record syntax (`karn.resolve.opaque_record_construction`,
`karn.types.opaque_record_construction`); `.raw` MUST be used only within the
defining `commons` (`karn.types.opaque_raw_outside`) and `.unsafe` only within
the defining context (`karn.types.opaque_unsafe_outside`).

{{#grammar-semantics refined_type}}

## §5.4 Agents & state

An `agent` MUST be declared inside a context (`karn.agent.outside_context`) and
MUST NOT declare `on http`, `on cron`, or `on queue` handlers (the
`karn.parse.*_in_agent` codes). Each agent handler's return type MUST be an
`Effect` (`karn.agent.return_not_effect`).

Every `state` field MUST have a defined initial value: either an **explicit
initialiser** — a compile-time constant of the field's type, not referencing
`self`, parameters, or capabilities (`karn.agents.bad_state_initialiser`) — or an
**implicit zero** (`Int` → `0`, `Bool` → `false`, `String` → `""`, `Option[T]` →
`None`, a record of zeroable fields). A field with neither is rejected
(`karn.agents.non_zeroable_state_field`).

A `commit` MUST occur only in an agent handler (`karn.commit.outside_agent`), its
value MUST match the agent's state type (`karn.commit.wrong_state_type`), and at
most one `commit` may be reachable on any execution path
(`karn.commit.two_reachable_commits`). Constructing or calling an agent MUST use
the right key arity and type and a declared handler (`karn.agent.construction_arity`,
`karn.agent.key_mismatch`, `karn.agent.handler_arity`, `karn.agent.handler_not_found`).

{{#grammar-semantics state_decl}}

## §5.5 Effects, capabilities & providers

Karn separates **pure** from **effectful** code. An `<-` bind MUST occur in an
effectful position and MUST be applied to an `Effect`
(`karn.effect.bind_in_pure_context`, `karn.effect.bind_on_non_effect`); a
capability call or a cross-context call MUST NOT occur in a pure context
(`karn.effect.capability_in_pure_context`, `karn.effect.cross_context_in_pure_context`).

A capability MUST be declared inside a context
(`karn.capability.outside_context`); a provider MUST implement exactly its
capability's operations — no missing, no extra, signatures matching
(`karn.provider.missing_operation`, `karn.provider.extra_operation`,
`karn.provider.signature_mismatch`) — and MUST name an existing capability
(`karn.provider.unknown_capability`). A handler or provider MUST declare every
capability it uses with `given`, and `given` MUST name a real capability; a call
to an undeclared capability is rejected and an unused one warned
(`karn.given.unknown_capability`, `karn.given.undeclared_capability`,
`karn.given.unused_capability`). Providers MUST NOT form a dependency cycle
through `given` (`karn.provider.dependency_cycle`).

{{#grammar-semantics given_clause}}

## §5.6 Pattern matching

A `match` MUST be **exhaustive** — every variant of the scrutinised sum,
`Result`, or `Option` covered (`karn.types.non_exhaustive_match`) — and its
scrutinee MUST be a sum type (`karn.types.match_non_sum_discriminant`). Its arms
MUST share a result type (`karn.types.match_arm_mismatch`), MUST NOT repeat a
variant (`karn.types.duplicate_variant_arm`), and MUST NOT be unreachable
(`karn.types.unreachable_arm`).

A pattern MUST name a real variant (`karn.types.unknown_variant_in_pattern`) and
real payload fields (`karn.types.unknown_pattern_field`), bind the right number
of fields (`karn.types.pattern_arity`), and MUST NOT mix named and positional
bindings (`karn.types.mixed_pattern_bindings`). An `is` check MUST be applied to a
value of the matching base or sum (`karn.types.is_base_mismatch`,
`karn.types.is_non_sum`, `karn.types.is_unknown_variant`).

{{#grammar-semantics match_expr}}

## §5.7 Handlers

A `service` MUST be declared inside a context (`karn.service.outside_context`) and
every service handler MUST return an `Effect` (`karn.service.return_not_effect`).

An `on http` handler MUST return `Effect[HttpResult[T]]`
(`karn.http.return_not_effect_http_result`); its route MUST be well-formed and
unique, MUST NOT use the reserved `/_karn/` prefix
(`karn.http.invalid_path`, `karn.http.duplicate_route`, `karn.http.reserved_prefix`),
and each `:name` segment MUST bind to a string-constructible parameter
(`karn.http.unbound_path_param`, `karn.http.path_param_not_stringy`,
`karn.http.extra_param`); `GET` and `DELETE` MUST NOT take a `body`
(`karn.http.body_on_get_or_delete`). An `on cron` handler MUST take at most one
`Int` parameter, a valid five-field schedule, and return `Effect[Result[(), E]]`
(the `karn.cron.*` codes); an `on queue` handler MUST take exactly one `message`
parameter, a non-empty queue name, and the same return shape (the `karn.queue.*`
codes).

{{#grammar-semantics http_handler}}

## §5.8 Boundaries & cross-context

`consumes` MUST appear only in a context, MUST name an existing context (not a
`commons` or itself), and MUST NOT produce colliding names or aliases (the
`karn.consumes.*` codes). Calling another context's service requires a `consumes`
declaration (`karn.resolve.unconsumed_context`), and contexts MUST NOT form a
`consumes` cycle (`karn.context.consumes_cycle`).

`exports` MUST name declared types or capabilities, MUST NOT export a name twice
or with conflicting visibility, and an exported capability MUST have a provider
(the `karn.exports.*` codes). A value crossing a boundary MUST be structurally
compatible with the receiving side ([§6.5](type-system.md#65-type-compatibility--boundaries),
`karn.boundary.structural_mismatch`); a context-owned type MUST NOT be constructed
or an opaque export inspected from outside (`karn.context.external_construction`,
`karn.context.opaque_inspection`).

An integration test MUST wire at least two distinct, declared contexts, MUST NOT
duplicate a participant or suite name, and MUST wire every consumed dependency
(the `karn.integration.*` codes).

{{#grammar-semantics consumes_decl}}

## §5.9 Testing constructs

An `assert` MUST occur only in a test case body and MUST be given a `Bool`
(`karn.assert.outside_test`, `karn.assert.non_bool`). A `test` block MUST target
an existing unit and MUST NOT duplicate a case description
(`karn.test.unknown_target`, `karn.test.duplicate_case_name`).

`Mock[T]` MUST occur only in a test body (`karn.mock.outside_test`), name a
resolvable type (`karn.mock.unknown_type`), and receive pins that are
compile-time literals of the right arity satisfying the type
(`karn.mock.pin_not_literal`, `karn.mock.arity`, `karn.mock.literal_violates`); a
type that cannot be fabricated MUST be pinned (`karn.mock.needs_pin`,
`karn.mock.unsupported_kind`). A `mocks` block MUST name an in-scope capability,
match its signature, and MUST NOT be used in an integration test or a commons
test (`karn.mock.unknown_target`, `karn.mock.signature_mismatch`,
`karn.integration.mock_in_integration`, `karn.mock.in_commons_test`).
