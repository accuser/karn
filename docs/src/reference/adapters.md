# Adapters

An **adapter** is the one declaration kind where a Bynk capability *contract*
sits adjacent to a non-Bynk *implementation*. It is the **only** place the host
boundary may exist — the single, named, greppable seam through which a
deploy-target runtime or an npm library enters a Bynk program. Everything else
stays pure Bynk.

An adapter declares capabilities and the boundary types they reference, names a
TypeScript **binding** that supplies the implementations, and `exports` the
capabilities to consumers. It may **not** declare services or agents, and its
providers are **external** (bodiless).

## Anatomy

```karn,ignore
adapter tokens {
  binding "./tokens.binding.ts" requires { "jose": "^5" }
  consumes karn { Secrets }     -- v0.18: adapter-to-adapter dependency

  exports capability  { Jwt }
  exports transparent { Claims, JwtError }

  type Claims   = { sub: String, exp: Int }
  type JwtError = enum { Invalid, Expired }

  capability Jwt {
    fn sign(claims: Claims) -> Effect[String]
    fn verify(token: String) -> Effect[Result[Claims, JwtError]]
  }

  provides Jwt = JoseJwt given Secrets   -- external: no body; supplied by the binding
}
```

- **`binding "<module>"`** names the TypeScript module (resolved relative to the
  adapter's source file) that exports the provider symbols. `requires { … }`
  declares npm dependencies; ranges must be pinned (no `*`/`latest`).
- **`provides Cap = Name`** with **no brace block** is an *external* provider:
  the compiler emits no class, and the binding must `export class Name implements
  Cap`. The `implements` is checked by `tsc --strict` — that is the contract
  between the two halves.
- **`consumes U { Cap, … }`** (v0.18) brings another adapter's capabilities into
  scope for the adapter's providers — see
  [Adapter dependencies](#adapter-dependencies) below.

## Adapter dependencies

An adapter may depend on **another adapter's** capabilities (v0.18). Its
`consumes` is restricted on two axes, each with its own diagnostic:

- **braced form only** — an adapter has no services to call, so the whole-unit
  and `as Alias` forms are rejected (`karn.adapter.consumes_requires_selection`);
- **adapter targets only** — an adapter may not consume a *context*
  (`karn.adapter.consumes_context`).

An external provider names its dependencies with the ordinary `given`; compose
builds a **by-name deps object** and passes it to the binding class
constructor:

```typescript
// tokens.binding.ts — keys are the `given` names, checked by tsc
export class JoseJwt implements Jwt {
  constructor(private deps: { Secrets: Secrets }) {}
  // … this.deps.Secrets.get("JWT_SECRET") …
}
```

```typescript
// compose.ts (generated) — the dependency is instantiated recursively
const Jwt = new tokens__binding.JoseJwt({
  Secrets: new karn__binding.SecretsProvider(),
});
```

The wiring is transitive: depending on a capability pulls its provider's
binding into the compose (and *its* dependencies, recursively). This is how
config and IO reach a binding — a secret or an HTTP client is a capability
dependency (`given karn.Secrets`, `given karn.Fetch`), never an operation
parameter or an env read in application code.

## The three flavours

| Flavour | Binding | Portability |
|---|---|---|
| **Library adapter** | one, npm-backed, user-authored | runs anywhere |
| **The `karn` surface** | one per platform, toolchain-supplied | portable |
| **Platform adapter** (`karn.<platform>`) | one, platform-only, toolchain-supplied | **platform-locked** |

The **`karn` surface** is the reserved, agnostic conformance core shipped with
the toolchain. The `karn` root namespace is reserved — no user unit may be
named `karn` or `karn.*` — and every first-party adapter lives inside it: the
surface unit `karn` (consuming only it keeps code **portable**) and the
`karn.<platform>` platform adapters (consuming one **locks** the deployment
unit — the prefix means *first-party*, not *portable*). As of v0.18 the surface
carries the full ambient set:

| Capability | Ops | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Clock` | `now() -> Effect[Int]` | |
| `Random` | `uuid() -> Effect[Uuid]`, `int(lo, hi) -> Effect[Int]` | `Uuid` is refined |
| `Logger` | `info(msg)`, `error(msg)` | |
| `Fetch` | `send(req: Request) -> Effect[Result[Response, FetchError]]` | typed core; see below |
| `Secrets` | `get(name: String) -> Effect[Option[String]]` | env-backed per platform |

`Fetch`'s `Request` carries `method` (`Method` enum), `url`, and
`contentType`/`authorization`/`body` as `Option[String]` fields; a general
`headers` list is deferred until Bynk has a sequence type, and widening
`Request` later is additive.

### Platforms

The deploy **platform** (`--platform {cloudflare,node}`, default `cloudflare`)
selects which `bynk-<platform>.ts` binding is linked. It is distinct from
`--target {bundle,workers}`, which chooses emit topology. Because the `karn`
contract names canonical provider symbols, the generated compose is
platform-identical — only the imported binding module differs. Porting Bynk to
a new runtime means implementing this one adapter's interfaces.

### Platform adapters & the lock

A **platform adapter** exposes a platform's real infrastructure as it is — no
portable intersection. The toolchain ships `karn.cloudflare` (`Kv` since
v0.19; `putTtl`/`list` since v0.23):

| Capability | Ops | Binding maps to |
|---|---|---|
| `Kv` | `get(key) -> Effect[Option[String]]`, `put(key, value) -> Effect[()]`, `putTtl(key, value, ttlSeconds) -> Effect[()]`, `delete(key) -> Effect[()]`, `list(prefix: Option[String]) -> Effect[List[String]]` | the Worker KV namespace at `env.KV` |

`putTtl` writes with an `expirationTtl`. `list` is a **drain**: the binding
follows the cursor internally and returns every matching key name — eager
and unbounded, so prefer a prefix on large namespaces (cursor-paging is
deferred; see ADR 0050).

**Structured values** are composition with the v0.22 codec, not extra ops —
store `Json.encode(entry)`, read back through `Json.decode[Entry]`:

```karn,ignore
service cache {
  on call(key: String, e: Entry) -> Effect[Option[Entry]] given Kv {
    let _ <- Kv.putTtl(key, Json.encode(e), 60)
    let stored <- Kv.get(key)
    match stored {
      Some(s) => match Json.decode[Entry](s) {
        Ok(decoded) => Some(decoded)
        Err(_) => None
      }
      None => None
    }
  }
}
```

```karn,ignore
context cache.store {
  consumes karn.cloudflare { Kv }   -- locks this deployment unit to cloudflare

  service cache {
    on call(key: String, value: String) -> Effect[Option[String]] given Kv {
      let previous <- Kv.get(key)
      let _ <- Kv.put(key, value)
      previous
    }
  }
}
```

Consuming it is **derived plumbing, not configuration**: the Worker's `Env`
gains a typed `KV: KVNamespace` field, its `wrangler.toml` a
`[[kv_namespaces]]` stanza (fill in the namespace `id` at deploy time), and on
the `bundle` target `composeApp` gains an optional `env` parameter to thread
the namespace through. The application never touches `env`.

It also **locks the deployment unit** — each context under `--target workers`,
the whole program under `bundle` — to the platform, along in-process `given`
edges (a service `consumes` between contexts is RPC and does not propagate).
Building with a different `--platform` is `karn.target.vendor_required`;
spanning two native platforms in one deployment unit is
`karn.target.vendor_conflict`. The `karn` surface and library adapters never
lock; a remote vendor API over HTTPS belongs in a library adapter (`given
karn.Fetch`), which stays portable. `Kv.list`, structured values, and `Queue`
arrive with the v0.22 extension.

## Consuming an adapter

A context `consumes` an adapter exactly as it consumes another context. Selected
capabilities can be flattened to bare names:

```karn,ignore
context auth.sessions {
  consumes karn   { Logger }   -- portable
  consumes tokens { Jwt }      -- library adapter; bare `Jwt` in scope

  service login {
    on call() -> Effect[String] given Jwt, Logger {
      let _     <- Logger.info("issuing token")
      let token <- Jwt.sign(Claims { sub: "u1", exp: 0 })
      token
    }
  }
}
```

`consumes U { Cap, … }` flattens the named capabilities into the consumer's local
namespace, so they read as `given Cap` / `Cap.op(…)` — identical to a locally
declared capability. The emitted TypeScript is the same as the qualified
`given U.Cap` form.

A consumed adapter is wired **in-process** (its binding is instantiated in the
composition root), never over a Service Binding — an adapter is not a deployment
unit.

## The binding as privileged constructor

A binding constructs its adapter's boundary types, which deliberately pierces
Bynk's construction discipline (only the defining unit may construct a type).
Inside a binding that rule does not apply — the binding *is* the host boundary.
To avoid coupling to the emitter's lowering, bindings construct boundary values
**only through the emitted constructors** — `Ok`/`Err`/`Some`/`None` from
`runtime.js`, a sum type's `T.Variant`, a record as an object literal, and a
**refined type through its validating `.of`** (handling the `Result`; a raw cast
or `.unsafe` bypasses the predicate and is disallowed).
