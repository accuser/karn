# Glossary

Terse, exact definitions of Karn's load-bearing terms. Each links to its fuller
reference page where one exists.

### agent {#term-agent}

A keyed, stateful entity whose state changes only through `commit` inside its
handlers. See [Agents](agents.md).

### context {#term-context}

A bounded context: an isolated module with its own services, agents, and provided
capabilities, reachable only across an explicit boundary.

### service {#term-service}

A named group of handlers (`on call`, `on http`, `on cron`, `on queue`) declared
inside a context. See [HTTP](http.md).

### capability {#term-capability}

An interface of effectful operations a context may depend on. See
[Capabilities & providers](capabilities.md).

### provider {#term-provider}

A `provides` block implementing a capability, optionally `given` other
capabilities it uses. See [Capabilities & providers](capabilities.md).

### commit {#term-commit}

The statement that writes an agent's next state; valid only in an agent handler.
See [Agents](agents.md).

### branded type {#term-branded-type}

A compiled type carrying a unique tag so values of distinct Karn types cannot be
interchanged in the emitted TypeScript; how opaque types stay distinct. See
[Emission](emission.md).

### opaque type {#term-opaque-type}

A type whose representation is hidden outside its defining module; constructed and
inspected only through its API. See [Type system](types.md).

### refined type {#term-refined-type}

A base or named type narrowed by a `where` predicate, e.g. `Int where Positive`.
See [Refined-type API](refined-types.md).

### sum type {#term-sum-type}

A tagged union of variants, each optionally carrying a payload. See
[Type system](types.md).

### record {#term-record}

A product type of named fields, each with a type and optional default. See
[Type system](types.md).

### enum {#term-enum}

A sum type whose variants all carry no payload. See [Type system](types.md).

### refinement predicate {#term-refinement-predicate}

A built-in constraint used in a `where` clause (`Positive`, `NonNegative`,
`InRange`, `Matches`, `MinLength`, …). See [Refined-type API](refined-types.md).

### admission {#term-admission}

The compile-time rule by which a literal that provably satisfies a refined type's
predicate is accepted directly (lowering to `.unsafe`), with no `Result`. See
[Refined-type API](refined-types.md).

### `.of` / `.unsafe` {#term-of-unsafe}

Constructors for a refined type: `.of` validates at run time and returns a
`Result`; `.unsafe` constructs without a check. See
[Refined-type API](refined-types.md).

### zeroable {#term-zeroable}

A type with a defined implicit zero value, letting an agent state field omit an
initialiser. See [Agents](agents.md).

### `Effect` {#term-effect}

The type of a computation that performs effects; produced by handlers and
capability operations and sequenced with `<-`.

### `Result` / `Option` {#term-result-option}

Errors-as-values types: `Result` is `Ok` or `Err`; `Option` is `Some` or `None`.
See [Type system](types.md).

### `Mock[T]` {#term-mock}

A test-only expression that fabricates a value of type `T`, optionally pinned to a
chosen value. See [Testing](testing.md).

### project vs legacy mode {#term-project-vs-legacy-mode}

*Project mode* is a `karn.toml`-driven directory layout (a `src`/`tests` split,
`karnc test`); *legacy mode* compiles a single `.karn` file as a standalone unit,
with no manifest. See [`karn.toml` manifest](manifest.md).
