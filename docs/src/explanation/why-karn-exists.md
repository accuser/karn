# Why Karn exists

This page is about motivation: the problems Karn is trying to solve, and the
bets it makes in solving them. It argues a position rather than documenting exact
behaviour — for that, see the [reference](../reference/index.md).

## The problem: services drift from their design

Most services begin with a clear architecture in someone's head — these are the
boundaries, this owns that state, this calls that. Almost none of that survives
contact with the code. The architecture lives in diagrams and tribal knowledge;
the code is a pile of functions and framework glue that *implements* the design
without ever *stating* it. Over time the two drift apart, and the gap is where
bugs and onboarding pain live.

Karn's first bet is that **the architecture should be in the language**. A
context is a deployable boundary. A service groups handlers. An agent is a named,
keyed owner of state. These are not naming conventions or folder layouts — they
are constructs the compiler understands and enforces. The shape of the system is
written down, checked, and compiled, so it cannot quietly rot.

## The bet: make illegal states unrepresentable

The second bet is that a great many runtime errors are really *type* errors that
the type system was too weak to catch. An order id is "just a string", so it gets
swapped with a customer id. A percentage is "just a number", so one day it is
`240`. An optional value is "usually there", until it isn't.

Karn pushes hard on the type system to close these gaps:

- **Refined types** carry a predicate, so `Age = Int where InRange(0, 150)` is a
  distinct type whose invalid values *cannot be constructed*. An out-of-range
  literal is a compile error, not a runtime surprise.
- **Opaque types** give a value a nominal identity, so an `OrderId` and a
  `CustomerId` never mix even though both are strings underneath.
- **Errors are values.** Operations that can fail return a `Result`; absence is
  an `Option`. There are no exceptions to forget to catch — the type forces the
  caller to handle both outcomes.
- **Agent state must be zeroable**, so a never-seen key has a well-defined
  starting state, and "uninitialised" is expressed honestly with `Option`.

The aim throughout is to move whole categories of bug from *runtime* to *compile
time* — to make the wrong program fail to build.

## The pragmatic choice: compile to typed TypeScript

The third bet is about reach. A new language with a new runtime asks the world to
adopt an entire ecosystem before it can be useful. Karn instead **compiles to
typed TypeScript** and targets **Cloudflare Workers**. That choice buys a lot:

- The output is ordinary TypeScript you can read, diff, and debug. There is no
  opaque bytecode and no mystery runtime.
- You inherit the JavaScript ecosystem and a mature, globally deployed serverless
  platform instead of reinventing them.
- A context maps cleanly to a Worker, and a stateful agent to a Durable Object —
  the deployment model and the language model line up.

It also has costs, which the companion page
[Why compile to TypeScript](why-compile-to-typescript.md) discusses honestly.

## What this adds up to

Put together, Karn is an attempt to make the *correct* way to build a service
also the *easy* way: state the architecture so it stays true, lean on the type
system so illegal states never compile, and ride a proven runtime instead of a
bespoke one. Whether that trade is worth it for you depends on the work — see
[Karn compared to TypeScript](karn-compared-to-typescript.md) for when to reach
for it.

If you have not yet, the fastest way to get the feel of these ideas is to build
something: start with [Tutorial 1](../tutorials/01-first-program.md).
