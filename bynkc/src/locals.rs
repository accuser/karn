//! v0.31 (ADR 0064): the local-binding sink.
//!
//! Records each local binding — `let`/`let <-`, lambda/fn/handler parameters,
//! and match-arm pattern bindings — with its **lexical scope range**, so the
//! LSP can offer/navigate locals (the recurring deferral: the v0.25 index, the
//! v0.27 hints, the v0.28 tokens, and v0.30.2 completion all stop at top-level
//! symbols for want of a scope-at-offset query).
//!
//! Mirrors [`HintSink`](crate::hints::HintSink): a `&mut` sink threaded through
//! the checker, recording at the binding sites as types are computed — so it
//! survives a transient error at the sites the checker still reaches, and (like
//! hints) it is not part of the `Ok(TypedCommons)` payload. Scope ranges are
//! taken from the enclosing block/body/arm span the checker already has at each
//! binding site, not re-derived — so nesting and shadowing are the checker's
//! own (tested) scoping, resolved in [`locals_at`]. Only synthetic files are
//! muted (locals serve completion/navigation in test files too).
