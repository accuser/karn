// `Connection[F]`. A `Connection<F>` is a typed handle to a long-lived channel;
// `send` writes a server→client frame, `close` ends the connection. The
// concrete implementations — a capture-and-inspect `TestConnection` for the
// bundle/test target and the hibernatable-WebSocket binding for Workers — arrive
// with the `from WebSocket` protocol (slice 3); the language emits against this
// interface, and the linearity discipline (§2.9) governs ownership at the type
// level.
