# Increment proposals

The working home for **active** increment proposals — and only active ones. A
proposal is a **transient input** to an increment, not a durable artefact: the
durable record of a landed increment is the code and its fixtures, the
[normative spec](../../docs/src/spec/index.md) updated in place, the
[decision records](../decisions/README.md), and the **reader-facing book**
(`docs/src/` — guides, reference, tutorials, changelog, roadmap) left current
and reliable. The spec is normative; the book is what a newcomer or evaluator
actually reads, and it is part of the increment, not a follow-up.

## Lifecycle

1. **Propose.** A draft lands here as `vX.Y-<slug>.md` via its own PR — or, for a
   **docs-only increment** (one that touches no grammar, compiler, emitter, or
   tooling — e.g. the concern-first book reorganisation), a plain `<slug>.md`
   with no version prefix. It is the sign-off artefact: the design forks marked
   `[DECISION]` with
   recommendations, the risks, a sketch of the spec delta, and a **docs delta**
   — which book pages the increment adds or changes (see [Documentation is part
   of done](#documentation-is-part-of-done)). A proposal with no docs delta must
   say *why* the book is untouched; silence is treated as an oversight, not a
   no-op. **Merging the proposal is the approval to build.**
2. **Implement.** The increment consumes the proposal: the grammar/compiler
   change with fixtures, the spec chapters updated in place, a decision record
   per language-defining call, the **book and changelog deltas** that keep
   `docs/src/` current and reliable, the tooling deltas, and — for a
   language/tooling increment — the version bump (`scripts/bump-version.sh` —
   see [Versioning & release](../README.md#versioning--release)). The book delta
   is a completion criterion, not optional polish. A docs-only increment carries
   **no version bump**: there is no language or tooling artefact to version, and
   the book's own currency banner is advanced to whatever version it now
   describes, not to a new one of its own.
3. **Delete.** The final implementation PR **removes the proposal file**. An
   empty directory means nothing is in flight. The proposal's history remains
   in version control (`git log -- design/proposals/`). On merge, a
   language/tooling increment is tagged `vX.Y.Z`; a docs-only increment is **not
   tagged** — it ships with its PR and bumps nothing.

## Writing one

Write a proposal knowing it will be consumed, not maintained. State **deltas
and decisions** — what changes, the forks and their recommendations, what the
spec sections will say. Do **not** duplicate normative content (full grammar
productions, worked emission output): the normative prose is written once, in
the spec, during implementation. Duplicated content is how the retired
instalment documents drifted.

## Documentation is part of done

The spec proves the language is *defined*; the book is what makes it *usable and
trusted*. An increment that ships a feature but leaves the book stale has not
landed cleanly — to a newcomer or evaluator a self-contradicting book reads as
"not seriously maintained", which is the most expensive impression a pre-1.0
language can give. So every increment leaves `docs/src/` **current and reliable**.
Concretely, the implementing PR must, *where the increment touches them*:

- **Document new or changed surface in the book, not only the spec.** A new
  language/tooling feature gets its reference page **and** its guide entry — and,
  for a genuinely new *concept*, the "Understand" on-ramp, not just a "Do"
  recipe. The spec is for lookup; the guides are the learning path.
- **Keep currency claims true.** Advance the "written against vX.Y" banner and
  `spec/appendix-version-history.md`; add the `reference/changelog.md` entry. The
  version the book *claims* to describe and the version it *does* describe must
  match.
- **Keep the roadmap honest in both directions.** Shipped behaviour must never be
  listed as "next/planned", and aspirational design must never be written in the
  present tense the book reserves for "what compiles today". Prefer naming
  *intent* over version-pinned milestones that rot on the next release.
- **Leave no dead links or stale framing.** Moving/renaming pages updates every
  inbound link (including the repo `README.md`) and any prose describing the docs'
  shape. The link-check / doc-example / spelling gates catch broken *references*;
  they do **not** catch a sample corrupted inside a code fence or a claim that
  silently went out of date — those are the author's responsibility.
- **Keep examples consistent and compiling.** Snippets demonstrating the same
  thing use the same form; prefer `{{#include}}` from a compiled worked example
  over hand-written fences so CI keeps them honest and they cannot rot.

If the increment genuinely touches none of these (e.g. a pure internal refactor),
say so in the proposal's docs delta — an explicit "no book impact, because …"
rather than an absent section.
