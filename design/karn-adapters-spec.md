# Karn Adapters — the Host Boundary

A spec for **adapters**: the one declaration kind in which a Karn capability
**contract** sits adjacent to a non-Karn **implementation**. An adapter, together
with the TypeScript **binding** it names, is the only place the host boundary is
allowed to exist — the single, named, greppable seam through which a deploy-target
runtime or an npm library enters a Karn program. Everything else stays pure Karn
and safe by construction.

Adapters come in three flavours, all the same kind:

- **Library adapters** — user-authored, a single npm-backed binding that runs on
  any target (`tokens` over `panva/jose`; `weather` over `fetch`).
- **The `karn` surface** — first-party; the **agnostic** capabilities Karn
  guarantees on every platform (`Clock`, `Random`, `Logger`, `Fetch`), with **one
  binding per platform**. It is the *platform conformance surface*; its `karn` root
  namespace is **reserved for the toolchain**. Code that consumes only `karn` is
  portable.
- **Vendor adapters** — first-party; a platform's full surface (`cloudflare` with
  `Kv`, `R2`, `Queue`, …; later `aws`), each a single vendor-only binding. Consuming a
  **platform-native** one **locks its deployment unit to that platform** — a deliberate
  commitment, scoped per deployment unit (a context under `--target workers`, the whole
  bundle under the default `bundle`) rather than inherited through a `consumes` edge
  (§5.3).

A consumer `consumes` any of them and uses the capabilities by bare name, unaware
of how they are implemented; the only thing that varies is *portability*. This
realises the design notes' **Tier 3 — platform bindings** and generalises it to the
**Anti-Corruption Layer** the notes describe (§"foreign types", §8). It builds on
**v0.15 cross-context capabilities**: the export-check, consumable-check and
provider-compose machinery are reused, but **bare-name flattening, clash detection
(§5.4), binding resolution (§3.5) and the platform-target axis (§6.2) are net-new**
— this is not a free ride on v0.15.

Read first: `grammar-increments/karn-mvp-grammar-v0.15.md` (cross-context
capabilities — this spec applies its machinery), `karn-design-notes.md` §8 (bounded
contexts; provided/consumed capabilities), the Tier-3 platform-bindings passage and
the Anti-Corruption-Layer discussion, `karn-type-system.md` §2.1.2, and v0.12
provider composition.

This is a **design draft for review**. Choices marked **[DECISION]** are the
language-defining calls to settle before implementation; they are collected in §12.

---

## 1. Scope

### 1.1 The gap

Today `given` only resolves capabilities a **context declares and provides**, and
a `provides` body is **pure Karn** — there is no escape hatch to the host anywhere
in the compiler. Two consequences:

- **No host-backed capabilities.** Time, randomness, outbound IO, storage, and any
  npm library are unreachable. A user-written `SystemClock.now()` can only return a
  constant (fixture `170` returns `0`); it cannot call `Date.now()`.
- **No contained place to put one.** Even if a body could call the host, allowing
  it in *any* context would punch an FFI hole through the language's core property
  — that user source is pure and safe by construction.

`provides` outside a context is already rejected (`diagnostics.rs:617`); a
capability already compiles to a TypeScript `interface` plus an injection token
(`emit_capability`, `emitter.rs:1844`); a provider already compiles to `class X
implements <Interface>` (`emit_provider`, `emitter.rs:1875`). The adapter fills the
gap with one new declaration kind permitted to bind a capability to an external
implementation — and nothing else gains that power.

### 1.2 Why not one agnostic platform — three tiers of portability

Making "the platform" a single agnostic surface under-serves real targets, because
platform capabilities fall into three portability tiers:

1. **Universal** — `Clock`, `Random`, `Logger`, `Fetch`. Identical semantics
   everywhere. An agnostic contract is *correct* and loses nothing.
2. **Common-shape, different-impl** — a KV store (Cloudflare KV vs DynamoDB vs
   Redis), a blob store (R2 vs S3), a queue. A portable abstraction is *possible*
   but lossy: the intersection, not the union.
3. **Vendor-unique** — Workers AI, Vectorize, Hyperdrive; Step Functions. No
   cross-platform equivalent; an agnostic contract is *impossible*.

So agnostic is right for tier 1, a compromise for tier 2, a non-starter for tier 3.
The resolution is to split: the **`karn` surface** carries tier 1 (portable, one
binding per platform); **vendor adapters** carry tiers 2–3 (full power,
platform-locked). The cost is visible at the `consumes` line. (Karn is not fully
vendor-neutral at its core anyway: agents are Durable-Object-shaped. The split
governs the *ambient-services* layer, not a claim that any program ports anywhere.)

### 1.3 The adapter model — three strata, one seam

The standard library has three strata; the host boundary falls between the second
and third:

1. **Pure stdlib** — types and pure functions (`Option`/`Result`/`Effect`; later
   string/math/json helpers). No host dependency. **Pure Karn.**
2. **Capability contracts** — `capability Clock { fn now() -> Effect[Int] }`.
   Target-independent interfaces; the surface `consumes`/`given` work against.
3. **Capability implementations** — `ClockProvider` calling `Date.now()`, `JoseJwt`
   calling `panva/jose`. Host code. **The adapter's binding** (a `.binding.ts`).

The contract (stratum 2) is read by three consumers at once — the *wiring*, the
*LSP*, and the *binding* — one source of truth.

### 1.4 Why a distinct kind (containment)

An adapter is not a context: it has no services, agents, or logic. Its own kind buys:

- **Containment.** External providers are legal **only** in an adapter; ordinary
  contexts remain provably free of host access. The host *boundary* is greppable —
  `adapter` finds the declared boundaries, and each adapter names its `.binding.ts`
  (§3.5), so the foreign **code** is exactly *those bindings*. (The dangerous code
  lives in the `.binding.ts`, not inside the Karn `adapter` unit — the auditable
  claim is "the boundary is greppable: `adapter` + its named binding," not "all
  foreign code sits inside adapter units.")
- **The marker dissolves.** A `provides` inside an adapter is external *by
  definition*: `provides Clock = ClockProvider` with no body is the normal form; a
  Karn body inside an adapter is the error.
- **It reads as architecture.** Capability-as-port, adapter-as-implementation.

### 1.5 In scope / out of scope

**In scope.**

- The `adapter` kind (§3): co-located contract + external providers + boundary types
  + `exports`; a named **binding** (§3.5); the reserved `karn` name prefix (§3.4).
- The **`karn` surface** (§4.2), **vendor adapters** (§4.3, target-locked §5.3), and
  **library adapters** (§4.1).
- The **binding as privileged constructor** of its boundary types (§4.4).
- A minimal **platform-target axis** (§6.2), distinct from the existing
  `--target {bundle,workers}` emit mode; the MVP ships the `cloudflare` platform only.
- The MVP capability set (§9): the env-free `karn` core (`Clock`, `Random`,
  `Logger`) plus `tokens`/`weather` library adapters.

**Out of scope (deferred).**

- **Env-backed capabilities** — vendor `Kv`, `Secrets`/`Env`, `Queue`, and `Fetch`'s
  full request/response surface — need the manifest→`wrangler` path (§6.2). Most
  vendor capabilities are env-backed, so **vendor adapters land with this tier**.
- **Additional platforms** (Node, Deno) — the MVP is `cloudflare`-only; the axis
  exists so they are additive.
- **Durable Object state as a capability**; **decorate/wrap overrides** (§7.2);
  **target-aware library adapters**; **a public binding ABI**.

## 2. The design at a glance

| Flavour | Binding(s) | Portability | Reserved? | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Library adapter | one, npm-backed | runs anywhere | no | `tokens` (jose), `weather` (fetch) |
| `karn` surface | one per platform | portable | **yes** (`karn.*`) | `Clock`, `Random`, `Logger`, `Fetch` |
| Vendor adapter | one, vendor-only | **platform-locked** | no | `cloudflare` (`Kv`, `R2`), later `aws` |

Mechanism (the same for all three): contract `capability Cap { … }`; external
`provides Cap = Sym`; a named `binding "<module>"`; bring into scope with `consumes U
{ Cap, … }`; override with a local `provides`; substitute with `mocks`.

Provider precedence: **test `mocks` › local `provides` › adapter default.**

---

## 3. Grammar

### 3.1 The `adapter` declaration — [DECISION A: keyword]

```
source-unit  ::= commons | context | test | adapter        -- adapter is NEW
adapter-decl ::= 'adapter' qualified-name adapter-body
adapter-body ::= '{' adapter-item* '}' | <fragment form>
adapter-item ::= binding-decl | capability-decl | provider-decl
               | type-decl | fn-decl | uses-decl | exports-decl
```

`adapter` is a new keyword (sibling to `commons`/`context`/`test`; not currently
reserved). An adapter may contain a binding declaration, capability declarations, the
boundary types they reference, **inline pure helper types and functions** (and `uses`
a commons to import shared ones — [DECISION B]), external providers, and `exports`. It
may **not** contain services, agents, or bodied providers — the effectful/logic kinds
that would make it a context. Inline helpers do not weaken containment: they are pure
Karn and cannot touch the host, so the host boundary is still only the binding (§3.5).

### 3.2 External providers (no body)

```
provider-decl ::= 'provides' cap-name '=' provider-name provider-body?
                                                       --   body  → Karn (context only)
                                                       -- no body → external (adapter only)
```

Inside an adapter, a provider has **no Karn body**: it names the implementation
symbol the binding must `export`. The compiler emits no class and records the
capability as binding-supplied. A *bodied* provider in an adapter is
`karn.adapter.provider_has_body`; a *bodiless* provider in a context is
`karn.context.external_provider`. The absence of the brace block — not an empty one
— is the signal.

### 3.3 Selected-capabilities `consumes` — [DECISION C]

```
consumes-decl ::= 'consumes' qualified-name                    -- whole, qualified (v0.4)
                | 'consumes' qualified-name 'as' identifier     -- aliased, qualified (v0.6)
                | 'consumes' qualified-name '{' name-list '}'   -- NEW: selected caps, bare names
```

```karn
consumes karn       { Clock, Logger }   -- portable
consumes tokens     { Jwt }             -- library adapter
consumes cloudflare { Kv }              -- vendor: locks this context to the cloudflare platform
```

Each listed name must be a capability the unit **exports**; it enters the consumer's
local capability namespace under its bare name, so it reads as `given Clock` /
`Clock.now()`. Bare-name flattening into the local `capability_info_map` is a **new
resolution path** (v0.15 only resolved qualified `given U.Cap`); it is what creates
the collision surface handled in §5.4.

### 3.4 The reserved `karn` name prefix

Karn has no hierarchical namespaces: a dotted unit name (`shop.orders`, `karn.time`)
is a single **flat** identifier, not a tree — `karn` and `karn.time` are *independent*
units that merely share a leading segment. The toolchain **reserves any unit name whose
first segment is `karn`**: no user `commons`, `context`, `adapter`, or `test` may be
named `karn` or `karn.<anything>` (`karn.namespace.reserved`). That keeps the platform
conformance surface (§4.2) unambiguous and makes `consumes karn…` a reliable marker of
a portable dependency.

> **Migration note.** Reserving `karn.*` is a deliberate, *non-additive* change: any
> prior program that used `karn` as a leading segment for a user unit (e.g. a
> `commons karn.time`) no longer compiles and must be renamed off the reserved prefix.
> This is the one intended exception to "prior programs compile identically."

### 3.5 Binding resolution — [DECISION J]

Compose must import a provider's implementation symbol from *some* TypeScript module;
the rule must be explicit (it is the central mechanical contract of the feature, and
`karn.adapter.no_binding` presupposes it). An adapter names its binding module
explicitly — greppable and rename-surviving, preferred over filename magic:

```karn
adapter tokens {
  binding "./tokens.binding.ts" requires { "jose": "^5" }
  ...
  provides Jwt = JoseJwt
}
```

- The path is resolved **relative to the adapter's source file**. Compose emits
  `import { JoseJwt } from "<resolved path>"` and constructs it.
- The module must `export` each symbol named by the adapter's `provides`; the
  `implements` is checked by `tsc --strict` (the symbol's existence likewise — a
  missing export surfaces there, plus an early `karn.adapter.no_binding` if the
  module/clause is absent for an adapter that declares external providers).
- `requires { … }` declares npm dependencies, folded into the generated
  `package.json` ([DECISION F]; the alternative is a sidecar manifest). How those
  declared deps are surfaced, pinned and trusted — a supply-chain concern, since
  third-party library adapters are a goal — is **[DECISION L]**.
- The **`karn` surface** omits the clause: its binding is **platform-keyed** and
  resolved by the toolchain (`karn` → the active platform's `karn-<platform>.ts`,
  §6.2). It is the *only* case with no fixed module.
- A **vendor adapter** *does* name its single binding with the same clause — the
  module is bundled with the toolchain rather than user-written, but naming it keeps
  resolution uniform (one binding, named, greppable), matching §4.3.

> The library binding (`tokens.binding.ts`) is an **input** the user writes — not an
> output emitted by the compiler. (§6.3 covers where *first-party* bindings live.)

---

## 4. Anatomy of an adapter

The contract is always target-agnostic; the *binding set* differs — one for a
library adapter (§4.1), one per platform for the `karn` surface (§4.2), one
vendor-only binding for a vendor adapter (§4.3). §4.4 governs how a binding may
construct the boundary types.

### 4.1 A library adapter — `tokens` over `panva/jose`

```karn
adapter tokens {                       -- library adapters: named for the capability (see naming note, §12)
  binding "./tokens.binding.ts" requires { "jose": "^5" }

  exports capability  { Jwt }
  exports transparent { Claims, JwtError }

  type Claims   = { sub: String, exp: Int }
  type JwtError = | Invalid | Expired

  capability Jwt {
    fn sign(claims: Claims, secret: String)  -> Effect[String]
    fn verify(token: String, secret: String) -> Effect[Result[Claims, JwtError]]
  }

  provides Jwt = JoseJwt                -- defined by the binding below
}
```

The compiler emits the interface + token any capability produces (`emit_capability`,
`emitter.rs:1844`), and *no* class for `JoseJwt`:

```ts
// tokens.ts (generated)
export interface Jwt {
  sign(claims: Claims, secret: string): Promise<string>;
  verify(token: string, secret: string): Promise<Result<Claims, JwtError>>;
}
export const JwtToken: unique symbol = Symbol("Jwt");
```

The binding (a user-authored input) implements that interface and constructs results
through the **emitted constructors** (§4.4), never raw tag shapes:

```ts
// tokens.binding.ts
import * as jose from "jose";
import type { Jwt, Claims } from "./tokens.js";
import { JwtError } from "./tokens.js";          // emitted variant constructors
import { Ok, Err, type Result } from "./runtime.js";

export class JoseJwt implements Jwt {
  async sign(claims: Claims, secret: string): Promise<string> { /* jose.SignJWT… */ }
  async verify(token: string, secret: string): Promise<Result<Claims, JwtError>> {
    try {
      const { payload } = await jose.jwtVerify(token, keyFrom(secret));
      return Ok({ sub: String(payload.sub), exp: Number(payload.exp) });  // Claims object literal
    } catch (e) {
      return Err(isExpired(e) ? JwtError.Expired : JwtError.Invalid);     // emitted ctors
    }
  }
}
```

`implements Jwt` against the generated interface **is** the contract between the two
halves, checked for free by `tsc --strict`.

### 4.2 The `karn` surface — the agnostic conformance core

First-party; its contract is **Karn-owned and platform-agnostic**, with **one binding
per platform**, and no `binding` clause (the toolchain supplies them). The MVP core:

```karn
adapter karn {                      -- the reserved, agnostic surface; shipped with the toolchain
  exports capability  { Clock, Random, Logger }
  exports transparent { Uuid }

  type Uuid = String where Matches("[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-…")   -- refined ([G])

  capability Clock  { fn now() -> Effect[Int] }
  capability Random {
    fn uuid() -> Effect[Uuid]                 -- refined, not bare String
    fn int(lo: Int, hi: Int) -> Effect[Int]
  }
  capability Logger {
    fn info(msg: String)  -> Effect[()]
    fn error(msg: String) -> Effect[()]
  }

  provides Clock  = ClockProvider     -- canonical symbols every platform binding must export
  provides Random = RandomProvider    -- (neutral, contract-flavoured names — see [DECISION H])
  provides Logger = LoggerProvider
}
```

Each platform supplies a binding implementing those canonical symbols (sharing code
where the host API is identical). Note `RandomProvider.uuid` constructing the refined
`Uuid` through its validating `.of` (§4.4) — `.unsafe` is not used even though crypto
guarantees validity:

```ts
// karn-cloudflare.ts            (also karn-node.ts, karn-deno.ts, …)
import type { Clock, Logger, Random, Uuid } from "./karn.js";
import { Uuid as Uuid_ } from "./karn.js";    // validating .of constructor
export class ClockProvider   implements Clock  { async now() { return Date.now(); } }
export class LoggerProvider  implements Logger {
  async info(m: string)  { console.log(m); }
  async error(m: string) { console.error(m); }
}
export class RandomProvider implements Random {
  async uuid(): Promise<Uuid> {
    const r = Uuid_.of(crypto.randomUUID());            // predicate runs (defence-in-depth)
    if (r.tag === "Err") throw new Error("unreachable: crypto uuid failed Uuid");
    return r.value;
  }
  async int(lo: number, hi: number): Promise<number> { /* getRandomValues in [lo,hi] */ return lo; }
}
```

(`Effect[Int]` lowers to `Promise<number>`; `Effect[()]` lowers to `Promise<void>` —
`ts_type_ref` maps `Unit` to `void` in the emitted interface, so the binding's
`Promise<void>` matches under `--strict`; verified at `emitter.rs:4371` and fixture
`170`'s `now(): Promise<number>`.) Because the contract names canonical symbols,
every platform's binding exports the same names and the generated compose is
**platform-identical** — only the imported binding module changes (§6.2). The `karn`
surface is the **platform conformance surface**: porting Karn to a new runtime means
implementing this one adapter's interfaces, with no change to consumer or domain code.

> The surface may be one adapter (`karn`) or several **independent** flat-named units
> (`karn.time`, `karn.log` — not a hierarchy; §3.4); the MVP ships a single `karn`, and
> splitting later is purely additive ([DECISION E]). Whether canonical provider symbols
> read as contract obligations (`ClockProvider`) or are platform-chosen via a manifest
> is [DECISION H].

### 4.3 Vendor adapters — a platform's full surface

First-party, a **single vendor-only binding**, and **platform-locked** (§5.3):

```karn
adapter cloudflare {                -- vendor adapter: named for the vendor (naming note, §12)
  binding "./cloudflare.binding.ts" -- first-party but bundled with the toolchain
  exports capability { Kv }

  capability Kv {
    fn get(key: String)                -> Effect[Option[String]]
    fn put(key: String, value: String) -> Effect[()]
  }

  provides Kv = WorkersKv
}
```

```ts
// cloudflare.binding.ts   (env-backed: needs a KV namespace binding — §6.2)
import type { Kv } from "./cloudflare.js";
import { Some, None, type Option } from "./runtime.js";

export class WorkersKv implements Kv {
  constructor(private ns: KVNamespace) {}
  async get(key: string): Promise<Option<string>> {
    const v = await this.ns.get(key);
    return v === null ? None : Some(v);
  }
  async put(key: string, value: string): Promise<void> { await this.ns.put(key, value); }
}
```

Most vendor capabilities are **env-backed** (a KV namespace from `env`), so vendor
adapters land with the env-backed tier (§6.2); the env-free `karn` core is the MVP. A
parallel `adapter aws { Dynamo, S3, … }` is an independent unit with its own binding —
no requirement to match `cloudflare`.

### 4.4 The binding as privileged constructor of boundary types

A binding *constructs* its adapter's boundary types — `Ok(claims)`, `Err(Invalid)`,
`Some(v)`. That deliberately pierces Karn's construction discipline (transparent
export means consumers may *read*, not *construct*; construction is reserved to the
defining unit and enforced by the type system — design-notes §§155/336). **Inside a
binding that rule does not apply**: the binding *is* the host boundary, and only
`tsc` checks shape there. Stated plainly, **the binding is a privileged constructor
of its adapter's boundary types.**

To keep hand-written bindings from coupling to the emitter's internal ADT lowering,
bindings construct boundary values **only through the emitted constructors**, never
open-coded tags:

- `Result` / `Option` via `Ok`/`Err`/`Some`/`None` imported from `runtime.js`
  (`{ tag: "Ok", value }` etc. — `emitter.rs:57`).
- each **sum type** via its emitted constructor namespace — `JwtError.Invalid`,
  `JwtError.Expired` (the emitter emits `JwtError = { Invalid: { tag: "Invalid" } as
  JwtError, … }`; cf. fixture `102`).
- each **record** as an object literal satisfying the emitted `interface` (structural;
  `tsc` checks it).

Writing `{ tag: "Invalid" }` by hand is disallowed by convention — it would break the
moment the lowering changes. ([DECISION] — if record construction ever needs more than
an object literal, the runtime should export record constructors too, on the same
principle.)

**Refined boundary types are a sharper case.** A refined type emits a *branded* alias
with a validating constructor `T.of(v) -> Result[T, ValidationError]` (plus a `T.unsafe`
escape hatch) — `emitter.rs:6`. `tsc` checks only the brand and shape, **never the
refinement predicate**, so a raw `value as Sku` cast (or `Sku.unsafe(value)`) would mint
a refined value the rest of Karn trusts as validated *without running its predicate*. A
binding must therefore construct a refined boundary type through its emitted `.of`
constructor and handle the `Result`; raw casts and `.unsafe` are disallowed by the same
convention as raw tags. **This holds even when the binding is a trusted *generator*** of
a value it believes valid: the `karn` surface's `Random.uuid()` ([G]) returns a refined
`Uuid`, and its binding still goes through `Uuid.of(crypto.randomUUID())`, unwrapping the
`Ok` and treating the (unreachable) `Err` as a bug — the predicate runs as
defence-in-depth rather than being trusted away. So this rule is **live in the MVP**, not
latent.

---

## 5. Static semantics

### 5.1 Resolving a selected-capabilities `consumes`

For `consumes U { C1, … }` in a consumer: `U` must be consumable and (for an adapter)
linked; each `Ci` must be a capability `U` **exports** (`karn.given.cross_context_unknown_capability`,
`diagnostics.rs:240`, reused); each `Ci` enters the consumer's local capability
namespace under its bare name (the **net-new** flattening path — §3.3 — over which
clash detection runs, §5.4).

### 5.2 Provider selection vs instance lifetime

Per build, **exactly one provider *binding* is selected per capability** — the impl
choice (adapter default, local override, or mock — see the precedence line below).
That is *not* one
instance: by default each consuming context's `compose` constructs its **own**
instance (`new karn.ClockProvider()` per compose, as fixture `170` shows). The
distinction is irrelevant for stateless caps (`Clock`) but a correctness question for
stateful ones (a KV client, a connection, a cache): two contexts taking the default
`Kv` get **two instances** unless sharing is requested. Shared/singleton provider
instances are a deferred feature; v1 is per-compose.

Precedence for the impl choice: **mocks › local `provides` › adapter default.**

### 5.3 The platform-locking rule — per deployment unit

The invariant is target-independent: **platform lock is local to a *deployment unit*** —
the unit that physically runs on one platform. It arises only from in-process use of a
**platform-native** capability, one whose binding runs only when deployed on that
platform (Cloudflare `Kv`, Durable Objects). What *counts* as a deployment unit depends
on the build target (`cli.rs` `CliTarget`):

- **`--target workers`** — one Cloudflare Worker per context; cross-context calls go over
  Service Bindings (RPC; `emitter/workers.rs`). The deployment unit **is the context**, so
  `consumes <context>` crosses a deployment-unit boundary and the lock **does not
  propagate** across it: a context's lock is exactly its own `consumes <native>` lines,
  greppable, nothing inherited. That edge may even cross *platforms* — A on Cloudflare
  calling B on AWS is a remote call (a natural, currently-unbuilt extension).
- **`--target bundle`** (the default) — cross-context calls compile to **direct
  in-process invocation**; the **whole program is one deployment unit**. The bundle's
  effective platform is the **union** of its contexts' native uses: if *any* context uses
  `Kv`/DO, the entire bundle is a Cloudflare deployment, and a context sharing that bundle
  is locked **without a native `consumes` line of its own**. Here the lock is
  co-locational — not through the `consumes` edge, but through sharing one bundle.

So, precisely: lock is **per deployment unit**; the `consumes` edge crosses deployment-
unit boundaries **only under `workers`**. `karn.target.vendor_required` fires when a
deployment unit uses a native capability but targets another platform;
`karn.target.vendor_conflict` when one deployment unit mixes two mutually-exclusive native
runtimes — *within a context* under `workers`, *anywhere in the bundle* under `bundle`.

Two things hold in both modes:

- **Not every vendor capability locks.** A *remote vendor API* (AWS S3 over HTTPS) is
  reachable from any platform — an ordinary **library adapter** (env-backed for
  credentials), no lock. Only **platform-native runtime bindings** (`Kv`, DO) lock; the
  "vendor adapter" category splits into *platform-native* (locks) and *remote-API*
  (library, no lock).
- The `karn` surface and library adapters impose no platform constraint at all.

> **MVP note.** The `karn` core (`Clock`, `Random`, `Logger`) has **no** platform-native
> capabilities, so the whole bundle-vs-workers locking distinction is **latent this
> increment**; it goes live only with the first vendor adapter.

### 5.4 Flattening scope — [DECISION D]

`consumes U { Cap }` flattening is defined for any exporting unit. Collision when two
consumed units export the same bare name (or one clashes with a local capability):
**reject (recommended)** — `karn.consumes.capability_name_clash`, resolved by qualified
`given U.Cap` or `consumes U as Alias`; versus **adapter-only flattening**.

### Diagnostic codes

| Code | Status | Cause |
|---|---|---|

## 6. Compilation to TypeScript

### 6.1 Compose wiring

For `consumes karn { Clock, Logger }` with no override, compose imports the providers
from the resolved binding (§3.5) and injects them — the deps-injection path of fixture
`170`:

```ts
// shop.orders compose.ts (generated)
import * as karn from "./karn-cloudflare.js";   // platform-resolved binding (§6.2)
const Clock  = new karn.ClockProvider();
const Logger = new karn.LoggerProvider();
const deps   = { Clock, Logger, env };
```

A local `provides Clock = FixedClock { … }` emits `class FixedClock implements Clock`
and compose constructs that; `mocks Clock` substitutes in the test build. `Clock.now()`
lowers to `deps.Clock.now()` in every case.

**Consuming an adapter is in-process, never RPC (verified, fixtures 176/177).** This is
the emitter-level reading of §5.3: an adapter is *not* a deployment unit. A consumed
*context* in `--target workers` is a separate Worker reached over a Service Binding, but
a consumed *adapter* is wired in-process via its binding. Concretely, for a consumer of
an adapter:

- the binding `.binding.ts` is **copied verbatim into the output** beside the adapter's
  emitted interface module, so the `import` resolves and `tsc --strict` checks the
  `implements` contract;
- compose instantiates the external provider from the binding module
  (`new tokens__binding.JoseJwt()`) — in `workers` it imports the binding at the out
  root (`../../tokens.binding.js`), in `bundle` at `./tokens.binding.js`;
- the consumer imports the adapter's capability **types** from the adapter's root module
  (`tokens.ts`), *not* from a per-Worker `handlers.ts` (an adapter has none);
- a consumed adapter therefore produces **no Service Binding** — no `Env` entry, no
  `wrangler.toml` binding — in either target. Only consumed *contexts* do.

This also means a consumer may construct an adapter's **transparent** boundary types
(e.g. `Jwt.sign(Claims { … }, secret)` in §8) — confirmed to compile and type-check;
transparent export affords field-level construction at the consumer, the binding is the
*privileged* constructor only for the stricter cases (refined types, §4.4).

### 6.2 Platform target (a new axis) and deploy bindings

The deploy **platform** (cloudflare / node / deno) is a **new selection axis** this
spec introduces. It is **distinct from the existing `--target {bundle,workers}`**
(`cli.rs` `CliTarget` / `BuildTarget`), which chooses emit topology, not a runtime.
There is no platform concept in the compiler today, so even the env-free MVP needs a
minimal one — the MVP is **not** target-free.

- **MVP:** a single platform, `cloudflare` (the existing `workers` emit mode targets
  Cloudflare Workers). Platform selection is a one-entry stub; the toolchain links
  `karn-cloudflare.ts`. The `karn-<platform>.ts` naming and the selection point are
  introduced now so Node/Deno are additive.
- **Selection** (strawman `--platform cloudflare`, defaulting to `cloudflare`) picks
  which `karn-<platform>.ts` links. Because the `karn` contract names canonical
  symbols, the Karn-side compose is platform-identical; only the import differs.
- **Env-backed** capabilities (vendor `Kv`, `Secrets`, `Queue`) need a binding threaded
  from `env`; the adapter manifest declares the requirement and the compiler both
  constructs the provider with it (`new cf.WorkersKv(env.KV)`) and emits the matching
  `wrangler.toml` stanza — the reason env-backed capabilities (and most vendor
  adapters) are deferred.

### 6.3 Binding distribution — [DECISION F]

- **Library adapter**: the binding is a **user input** named by the `binding` clause
  (§3.5); its npm deps fold into `package.json`.
- **`karn` surface / vendor adapter**: the toolchain **supplies** the binding (`karn`
  per platform; a vendor adapter one binding). Whether first-party bindings are
  **emitted into the project** (inspectable, no hidden dependency — recommended) or
  shipped as a **published package** is the open call here.

---

## 7. Testing & override

### 7.1 Testing — a mock plus a partial link

A consumed capability sits in the local namespace, so it is mocked with the same
`mocks` surface as a local provider (fixture `104`):

```karn
test shop.orders {
  mocks Clock  = FrozenClock  { fn now() -> Effect[Int] { 1_700_000_000 } }
  mocks Logger = SilentLogger {
    fn info(msg: String)  -> Effect[()] { () }
    fn error(msg: String) -> Effect[()] { () }
  }

  test "stamps the order with the clock" {
    let order <- ordering.call("ABC-123")
    assert order.placedAt == 1_700_000_000
  }
}
```

One thing is *not* fixture-104-verbatim: 104 mocks a local Karn provider, whereas
mocking an **adapter default** means the test build must **partially link the binding**
— link the impls for un-mocked caps, suppress the binding for the mocked ones. That
partial-link selection is new wiring. The payoff stands: time, randomness and IO are
injected, `Effect`-tracked, and deterministically mockable — a `cloudflare`-consuming
context's test runs without Cloudflare.

### 7.2 Override is replace, not decorate (for now)

Replacing the adapter default with a pure impl is in scope (`provides Clock =
FixedClock { … }`). Decorating it (wrapping the adapter's impl) needs a way to name the
shadowed base (the "super" problem) and is deferred.

---

## 8. Worked examples

A library adapter consumed by a portable context:

```karn
context auth.sessions {
  consumes karn   { Logger }   -- portable
  consumes tokens { Jwt }      -- portable (jose runs anywhere)

  service login {
    on call(secret: String) -> Effect[String] given Jwt, Logger {
      let _     <- Logger.info("issuing token")
      let token <- Jwt.sign(Claims { sub: "u1", exp: 0 }, secret)
      token
    }
  }
}
```

A portable consumer of the `karn` surface — only the `consumes karn { … }` line
distinguishes it from a hand-rolled local capability:

```karn
context shop.orders {
  uses money                        -- pure: types + functions
  consumes karn { Clock, Logger }   -- effectful: capabilities, bare names; portable

  type Order = { sku: String, placedAt: Int }

  service ordering {
    on call(sku: String) -> Effect[Order] given Clock, Logger {
      let _   <- Logger.info("placing order")
      let now <- Clock.now()
      Order { sku: sku, placedAt: now }
    }
  }
}
```

A context that opts into a platform-native vendor capability — locked to Cloudflare at
this line. Under `--target workers` a context that merely `consumes catalog.cache` calls
it over RPC and stays unlocked; under the default `bundle` it shares the deployment and
the lock with it (§5.3):

```karn
context catalog.cache {
  consumes karn       { Logger }   -- portable part
  consumes cloudflare { Kv }       -- vendor: this unit now requires the cloudflare platform

  service cache {
    on call(key: String) -> Effect[Option[String]] given Kv {
      let hit <- Kv.get(key)
      hit
    }
  }
}
```

The foreign **code** is the named bindings (`tokens.binding.ts`, the toolchain's
`karn`/`cloudflare` bindings); the foreign **boundaries** are greppable as `adapter`.

---

## 9. The MVP capability set

Prove the mechanism on the **env-free `karn` core** first — no `wrangler` wiring —
plus `tokens`/`weather` as library exemplars. Vendor adapters follow with the
env-backed tier.

| Capability | Adapter | Ops | Binding maps to |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Clock` | `karn` | `now() -> Effect[Int]` | `Date.now()` |
| `Random` | `karn` | `uuid() -> Effect[Uuid]` (refined), `int(lo,hi) -> Effect[Int]` | `crypto.randomUUID()` / `getRandomValues` |
| `Logger` | `karn` | `info(String) -> Effect[()]`, `error(String) -> Effect[()]` | `console.*` |
| `Jwt` | `tokens` (library) | `sign`, `verify` | `panva/jose` |
| `Weather` | `weather` (library) | `current` | a remote API over `fetch` |

(The §4.2 `karn` example shows exactly this core — `Clock`, `Random`, `Logger`.)
`Fetch` joins the `karn` core as a fast follow (env-free, but real request/response
type design). ID-result typing ([DECISION G]): refined (`Uuid`) vs plain `String`.

## 10. Implementation notes

### 10.1 Where new code goes

| Area | File | Change |
|---|---|---|
| AST | `ast.rs` | new `Adapter` `SourceUnit`; optional `ProviderDecl.body`; `binding` decl |
| Parser | `parser.rs` | `adapter q { … }`; `binding "<path>" requires {…}`; bodiless `provides`; adapter item rules; reject `karn`/`karn.*` user units |
| Resolver | `resolver.rs` | flatten selected caps to bare names; carry binding module + provider symbols; record vendor-adapter platform; compute effective platform transitively |
| Checker | `project.rs` / `checker.rs` | adapter item rules; bodiless-vs-bodied placement; clash; platform-lock propagation + conflict; treat external provider as "provided" |
| Emitter | `emitter.rs` `emit_provider` | emit no class for external providers; emit interfaces/types/exports as usual |
| Emitter (compose) | `emitter/workers.rs` | import provider from the resolved binding module; construct; deps; partial-link for mocks; `env` threading (later) |
| Platform axis | `cli.rs` / `project.rs` | a minimal `--platform` (MVP: `cloudflare` only), distinct from `--target {bundle,workers}`; select `karn-<platform>.ts` |
| Link / project | `project.rs` | resolve `binding` modules; fold library npm deps into `package.json`; first-party binding provisioning |
| `karn` + vendor sources | first-party `adapter` + bindings embedded in the toolchain | `Clock`/`Random`/`Logger`; later `cloudflare` |
| Diagnostics | `diagnostics.rs` | the new codes (§5) |

### 10.2 Risk areas

- **Binding resolution** — relative-path resolution, missing-export detection (early
  vs at `tsc`), and npm-dep provenance without arbitrary build-config injection.
- **Platform axis vs emit mode** — `--platform` (new) must not be conflated with
  `--target {bundle,workers}` (existing).
- **Platform lock is per deployment unit** — the context under `--target workers`, the
  whole program under `bundle`; derive each unit's effective platform from the native
  capabilities it contains (don't propagate across the `consumes` RPC edge under
  `workers`); distinguish platform-native bindings (lock) from remote-API library adapters.
- **Partial link for mocks** — suppress the binding for mocked caps, link it for the
  rest.
- **Adapter item discipline; reserved `karn` prefix; bare-name clashes.**
- **Refined boundary construction** — a binding must build a refined boundary type via
  its validating `.of`, never a raw cast or `.unsafe`; `tsc` enforces the brand but not
  the predicate, so a bypass is invisible to the gate (§4.4).
- **`tsc --strict` across the seam** — interface, binding `implements`, deps object.

### 10.3 What "done" looks like

1. Prior fixtures pass (additive).
2. `consumes karn { Clock, Logger }` compiles; emitted handler matches local-capability
   output; compose injects the platform-resolved `karn` binding.
3. A `tokens` adapter compiles; its `binding` module resolves; `implements Jwt`; npm
   dep reaches `package.json`; a consumer signs a token; the binding constructs results
   via emitted constructors only.
4. A deployment unit using a platform-native capability builds only for that platform;
   under `workers` a context that merely `consumes` it over RPC stays unlocked; two
   mutually-exclusive native runtimes in one deployment unit (a context under `workers`,
   anywhere in the `bundle`) conflict.
5. A user unit named `karn`/`karn.*` is rejected.
6. Override and `mocks` beat the default per precedence; a mocked-cap test partially
   links the binding.
7. Emitted output passes `tsc --strict`; `cargo test`, clippy, fmt clean.

---

## 11. Tooling & docs delta (required)

- **tree-sitter** / **vscode** / **karn-fmt**: the `adapter` unit, the `binding`
  clause, bodiless `provides`, braced `consumes`; corpus + idempotency fixtures;
  keyword list gains `adapter`.
- **karn-lsp**: `consumes ` autocompletes the `karn` surface, vendor adapters and
  project adapters; capability/hover from the contract; surface a vendor adapter's
  platform lock and a unit's **effective platform** (§5.3).
- **Docs**: an "Adapters" reference (three flavours, the `karn` surface, vendor
  adapters, reserved `karn` prefix, binding resolution, the privileged-constructor rule,
  per-deployment-unit platform locking (bundle vs workers), `consumes`-as-RPC); a "Wrap a
  library as an adapter"
  how-to (jose /
  the `weather` fetch example); troubleshooting for the new diagnostics; regenerate
  `grammar.md` + `diagnostics.md`.

## 12. Decisions

**Settled in review** (▸ marks the call):

1. **[A] Keyword** — ▸ `adapter`.
2. **[B] Adapter contents** — ▸ inline pure helper types/functions and `uses` are
   allowed; no services, agents, or bodied providers. Pure helpers don't pierce
   containment (they can't touch the host), so the boundary is still only the binding.
3. **[C] Mixin clause** — ▸ `consumes U { … }` (the effectful edge; not `uses`).
4. **[D] Flattening scope** — ▸ general; a clash is `karn.consumes.capability_name_clash`.
5. **[E] `karn` surface shape** — ▸ Karn names are flat (no hierarchy); one `karn`
   adapter for the MVP, splittable later into independent `karn.*` units; the leading
   `karn` segment is reserved (§3.4).
6. **[F] Binding distribution** — ▸ a library binding is a user input named by the
   `binding` clause; first-party bindings are emitted into the project; npm deps are
   declared in the `binding` clause.
7. **[G] ID types** — ▸ refined (`Uuid`); the binding constructs it via the validating
   `.of`, even as a trusted generator (§4.4).
8. **[H] `karn` provider symbols** — ▸ canonical, contract-flavoured names (e.g.
   `ClockProvider`; avoid impl-flavoured `SystemClock`), not per-platform manifest.
9. **[I] Tier-2 portability** — ▸ vendor-only for v1; no lossy portable port yet.
10. **[J] Binding resolution** — ▸ an explicit `binding "<module>"` clause (greppable,
    rename-safe).
11. **[K] Platform lock** — ▸ per **deployment unit**: a context under `--target workers`
    (the `consumes` RPC edge doesn't propagate lock), the whole program under the default
    `bundle` (co-location locks the shared bundle). Platform-native bindings lock,
    remote-API library adapters don't; cross-platform RPC is a future extension (§5.3).

**Still open:**

12. **[L] Adapter dependency trust** — direction set (declared `requires` deps pinned and
    surfaced for review), but the full allow-list / confirmation policy is TBD. A
    supply-chain surface (a malicious adapter could declare `requires { "evil": "*" }`),
    load-bearing because third-party library adapters are a goal.

**Naming-convention note.** The three flavours name themselves differently — `tokens`
(by capability), `cloudflare` (by vendor), `karn` (by toolchain). Since the doc makes
naming carry meaning, this is a mild inconsistency; the working rule is *library
adapters by capability, vendor adapters by vendor, the reserved surface as `karn`*.
Worth stating in docs rather than pretending it's uniform.

---

## 13. Roadmap

- **This increment:** the `adapter` kind, bodiless external providers, the `binding`
  clause, `consumes U { … }`, the reserved `karn` prefix, a minimal `--platform`
  (cloudflare), and the env-free `karn` core (`Clock`, `Random`, `Logger`), plus
  `tokens`/`weather` library exemplars.
- **Next:** `Fetch` on the `karn` core; then the env-backed tier and the first
  **vendor adapter** (`cloudflare`: `Kv`, `Queue`, …) with the manifest→`wrangler`
  path and the platform-locking rule.
- **Later:** more `karn` platforms (Node, Deno); an `aws` vendor adapter; shared/
  singleton provider instances; the decorate/wrap override; a public binding ABI.
