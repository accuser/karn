# Design notes

Internal design records for Karn. These are the working references behind the
language and tooling — distinct from the published book under `docs/`, which is
the canonical, reader-facing spec and reference.

## Current state

- [`proposals/`](proposals/README.md) — **active increment proposals**: the
  transient sign-off artefact for an increment, deleted by the PR that
  implements it.
- [`tracks/`](tracks/README.md) — **feature-track design docs** (ADR 0076): the
  *persistent* design + slice decomposition for a far-reaching, multi-increment
  language feature. Unlike a proposal, a track doc is not deleted on merge; it is
  the living map the per-slice proposals are cut from.
- [`decisions/`](decisions/README.md) — the **decision records**: one ADR per
  language-defining call, harvested from the retired increment instalments and
  added per increment going forward.
- [`karn-status-and-roadmap.md`](karn-status-and-roadmap.md) — where the project
  is and where it's going.
- [`karn-design-notes.md`](karn-design-notes.md) — the long-form design rationale.
- [`karn-type-system.md`](karn-type-system.md) — the type system in depth.
- [`karn-lsp-spec.md`](karn-lsp-spec.md) — LSP capabilities; referenced from
  `karn-lsp/src/main.rs` and `karnc/src/fmt.rs`.
- [`karn-tree-sitter-spec.md`](karn-tree-sitter-spec.md) — tree-sitter highlight
  groups; referenced from `tree-sitter-karn/queries/highlights.scm`.
- [`karn-phd-exploratory-memo.md`](karn-phd-exploratory-memo.md) — exploratory
  research memo.

## Versioning & release

The repo carries a **single version** while everything lives together. The
sites that must agree — the Cargo workspace (`[workspace.package]` plus the
in-workspace dependency requirements), `vscode-karn` (`version` *and*
`karnServerVersion`, the GitHub Release the extension downloads server
binaries from), and `tree-sitter-karn` — are all set by one command:

```sh
scripts/bump-version.sh X.Y.Z
```

The extension pin is why drift is behavioural, not cosmetic: a trailing
`karnServerVersion` means users get a stale compiler even after a release.

Per release:

1. The **implementing PR** runs the bump script and lands the version bump
   with the increment (alongside the spec/changelog deltas).
2. To ship a version, **tag `vX.Y.Z`** — the release workflow then does the
   whole release from that one tag: `verify` (tests + tag/version match) →
   build the binaries + cut the GitHub Release, **and** publish the crates to
   crates.io and the grammar to npm (both via OIDC Trusted Publishing, both
   re-run-safe — a version already on a registry is skipped, so a partial
   publish can be retried by re-running the run).
3. A release tag is cut when a version is to be shipped (not necessarily every
   increment) — the GitHub Release the extension's `karnServerVersion` pin
   points at must exist. A manual `workflow_dispatch` against the tag re-runs
   just the registry publishes (the override / retry path).

The release workflow's `verify` job refuses a tag whose version does not
match **all** of the sites above. The registry publishes are irreversible; the
`verify` gate stands in for an approval gate (an Environment with required
reviewers can add a one-click pause once the repo is public).

## History

The per-increment grammar instalments (`grammar-increments/`,
`karn-adapters-spec.md`) have been **removed**: the normative spec in
`docs/src/spec/` is the single source of truth for the shipped language, updated
in place per increment. The instalments' history lives in version control; the
design decisions they recorded live on in [`decisions/`](decisions/README.md).
