# Decision records

The design decisions that shaped Karn's incremental evolution, one record per
language-defining call: `Status / Context / Decision / Consequences`, each
citing the [normative spec](../../docs/src/spec/index.md) section that now
embodies it. Records were harvested from the retired per-increment instalment
documents (see the spec's Appendix B); from v0.19 on, each increment adds its
records here as part of the increment itself.

A record is **immutable once accepted** — a reversal is a new record that
supersedes the old one, the way 0016 supersedes the interim portability tiers.
