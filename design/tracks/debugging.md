# Tooling track — Debugging: source-mapped step debugging for Bynk

- **Phase:** 🟢 **Slice 0 landed — settled, slice 1 next.** No production code yet,
  but the format is no longer open: the two foundational ADRs are accepted
  ([0103](../decisions/0103-source-map-contract.md) source-map contract, [0104](../decisions/0104-debug-launch-model.md) debug-launch model), ratified against a
  throwaway spike that stepped `?`/`match` under the V8 inspector (see *Decision
  log*). Slices 1–4 below now cut as ordinary `vX.Y-<slug>.md` proposals from v0.67
  onward, implementing the settled contract. **Scope decided up front:** a
  *phased* approach — ship the pragmatic, source-map-plus-reused-JS-debugger base
  first, defer the bynk-native semantic layer; two run targets, **local
  `wrangler dev` (workerd)** and the **plain-Node test runner**; **remote /
  deployed Worker debugging is out of scope** for this track.
- **Realises:** the design-notes §19 compilation commitment — the emitted
  TypeScript "preserves source-level identifiers, **carries source maps for stack
  traces and debuggers**" (`bynk-design-notes.md` §19, and the pipeline's phase 8,
  "Bundling and source maps") — which is *committed but unbuilt*. **Note the split:**
  this track discharges the *debugger* half (the live attached session, slices 1–4);
  the *stack-trace* half resolves through the **production bundled map** (phase 8,
  esbuild/`wrangler` chaining), which is the deferred/uncertain path — so slice 1
  realises the §19 debugger promise, **not** the full stack-trace one (see *On
  merge* and open question 3). And it unblocks
  the parked line "a debugger plugin for VS Code is desirable but **follows the
  LSP work**" (`bynk-design-notes.md`): the LSP arc (`tracks/lsp.md`) is
  substantially complete, so the dependency is discharged.
- **Depends on / sequences after:** the **crate-decomposition track** (`bynk-emit`
  now owns TS emission, ADRs 0099–0102) — every source-map change lands in
  `bynk-emit`, not a monolith; and **`bynk dev`** (v0.57, ADR 0096) — the workerd /
  `wrangler dev` orchestration the debugger attaches to. **Refreshes:**
  `bynk-tooling-roadmap.md` (adds a debugging thread under the VS Code §4 work) and
  corrects `tracks/lsp.md`'s desirable-feature survey, which today omits debugger-
  oriented providers as N/A "— Bynk has no debugger." This track flips that premise.
  (Inline values, one of those omitted providers, is driven by the *debug session*,
  not the LSP server — so it belongs to the Phase-2 semantic layer (slice 5), not to
  shipping the base.)

## Why a track and not a single proposal

This earns a persistent doc on two of ADR 0076's triggers. It is **unavoidably
multi-increment**: the source-map foundation, the Node consumer, the workerd
consumer, and the extension wiring are separate slices that *share one artefact*
— a single map format and a single launch surface. And its foundation is
**hard-to-reverse infrastructure**: source maps require threading source spans
through the emitter's core writer (today a one-way string pipe — see *Current
state*), a change every later slice and every future codegen feature inherits. A
lone delete-on-merge proposal would settle the map format for the Node slice and
discard the reasoning the workerd and semantic slices need. It is a **tooling
track** (like `lsp.md` / `crate-decomposition.md`), *not* an ADR 0076 feature
track — no language surface, no `where`-type tension, no threat model — but the
multi-increment, shared-contract shape is the same.

## The throughline

> **The whole feature reduces to one hard capability plus glue.** The hard
> capability is *faithful source maps from the emitter*. Everything downstream —
> breakpoints, stepping, call stacks, variable inspection — is **wiring VS Code's
> existing JavaScript debugger to data we already produce**, because Bynk compiles
> to readable TypeScript running on a **V8 runtime that already speaks the
> inspector protocol** (`workerd`, via `wrangler dev`; and `node --inspect` for
> the test path). We are **not building a Debug Adapter.** We are teaching the
> compiler to emit maps and the extension to launch-and-attach. The pragmatic
> phase puts real breakpoints, stepping, and variables onto `.bynk` source; the
> deferred semantic phase makes the *values* read in Bynk's vocabulary.

Every claim below was confirmed by reading the emitter and the build writer, not
inferred: the string-concatenation emit in `bynk-emit/src/emitter/emit.rs`
(~150 `writeln!`/`push_str` write sites), the central statement writer
`write_line` in `emitter/lower.rs`, the AST's retained `Span` (`bynk-syntax/src/ast.rs`), and the
output writer `write_output` (`bynk-emit/src/lib.rs`) that writes
`file.typescript` with no `.map` sibling.

## Current state — the reality check

**There is no source-map infrastructure, and adding it is the load-bearing
slice.** Three facts set the cost:

1. **The emitter is a one-way string pipe that discards position.** Lowering walks
   the checked AST and *appends strings* — `emit.rs` is ~150 `writeln!`/`push_str`
   write sites; `lower.rs` routes statements through a single `write_line(out, indent, s)`
   helper. The AST nodes in hand **carry `Span`** (`ast.rs` — `pub span: Span` on
   every node, exactly the "full position information for source maps" §19
   promised), but the emitter **never reads it**: input span in, anonymous text
   out. Source maps need both ends — the *input* span and the *output* line/column
   — threaded through that writer. This is the real work; the rest is downstream of
   it.
2. **The build writer emits no map artefact.** `write_output` (`bynk-emit/src/lib.rs`)
   writes each `ProjectOutput` file's `.typescript` to disk and nothing else — no
   `.ts.map` sibling, no `//# sourceMappingURL` trailer. It is the *shared* writer
   behind `bynkc`'s `compile`/`test` and `bynk dev`'s in-process build (slice 7),
   so a map written here reaches every consumer uniformly.
3. **The runtime target already speaks the inspector.** Local dev is `workerd` via
   `wrangler dev` (`bynk dev`, v0.57); production is Cloudflare Workers. `workerd`
   exposes a **V8 inspector (Chrome DevTools Protocol)**, and `wrangler dev`
   supports an inspector port. The test path runs emitted TS on **Node ≥ 18**
   (`NODE_MAJOR_FLOOR`, `bynk-emit/src/lib.rs`), which exposes `--inspect`. Both
   targets are attachable by VS Code's built-in JS debugger today — the only thing
   missing is the maps that relocate its breakpoints and frames onto `.bynk`.

**The extension contributes no debugger.** `vscode-bynk` hosts the LSP
(`LanguageClient` over stdio) and contributes grammar, snippets, tasks, and
commands — but `package.json` has **no `debuggers` / `breakpoints` contribution**
(tooling-roadmap §3–§4). There is nothing to extend; this is greenfield on the
extension side, which is to our advantage — the surface is small.

## The architecture decision — reuse, don't build an adapter

For a compile-to-JS language on a V8 runtime, the idiomatic path is **not** a
from-scratch Debug Adapter. It is:

1. **Emit source maps** in `bynk-emit` mapping generated `.ts` back to `.bynk`.
2. **Run the target under an inspector** — `wrangler dev` with its inspector port,
   or `node --inspect-brk` for the test entry.
3. **Attach VS Code's built-in JavaScript debugger** (`pwa-node` for Node;
   CDP-attach for `workerd`). The source maps relocate breakpoints, call-stack
   frames, and scopes onto `.bynk`; stepping follows source lines; `names` in the
   map let variable inspection read source identifiers.
4. **Contribute a thin `DebugConfigurationProvider`** in the extension that
   resolves a `"type": "bynk"` launch into the underlying JS debug session —
   *compile → start the target with the inspector → hand off*. Glue and
   configuration, not a bespoke protocol implementation.

The cost lands almost entirely in step 1 (the emitter); steps 2–4 are
configuration and a small provider. The deferred **bynk-native** layer (Phase 2)
is the only place a custom adapter or a variable-formatter contribution might earn
its keep — see slice 5.

## The source-map design — the load-bearing questions

The map format is where an ADR earns its place. The genuine decisions:

- **Granularity — line/statement vs expression.** The natural seam is the existing
  `write_line` statement writer: attach one mapping per emitted statement line back
  to its source statement's span. **Leaning line/statement-level first** — it matches
  §19's "readable, source-identifier-preserving TS" intent, is cheap at the one writer
  seam, and is enough for breakpoints and stepping. But this is a *lean, not a settled
  call*: Bynk's lowering is unusually heavy (one source line can explode into many
  generated lines with non-obvious step order — `match`→`switch`, `?` propagation,
  comprehensions, combinator chains), so the slice-0 spike (open question 2) can
  overturn it toward expression-level. Expression-level is a deferred refinement *only
  if* the spike confirms line-level steps acceptably.
- **Identifier names.** §19 already commits the emitter to *preserving
  source-level identifiers*, so the map's `names` array is mostly free — populate
  it so the debugger's variable panes show Bynk names, not lowered temporaries.
- **Placement.** A sibling `<file>.ts.map` per emitted file plus a
  `//# sourceMappingURL=` trailer on the `.ts`; `sources` point at the `.bynk`
  files (relative), `sourcesContent` optional (embed for portability vs. keep maps
  small — settle in the ADR). **One forcing factor on that "optional":** under
  `workerd` the `.bynk` source may not sit at a path the inspector can resolve, which
  can push toward embedding `sourcesContent` regardless — a known pressure, not a free
  choice. `write_output` gains a map-writing pass.
- **Emission gating — and the production-exposure edge it carries.** `write_output` is
  the *shared* writer behind `bynkc compile`, `bynkc test`, and `bynk dev`, so a naïve
  map-writing pass emits maps for **plain production compiles too**, not just debug
  runs. Combined with the `sourcesContent`-embedding pressure above, an always-on map
  would **ship `.bynk` source into the deployed Worker bundle**. So the ADR must settle
  *when* maps emit and *what they carry on release*: debug-build-only emission, or
  always-emit-but-strip-`sourcesContent`-on-release, or map-without-embed. Not a
  detail — it's the source-confidentiality decision, and it belongs beside the
  placement call, not in implementation.
- **The lowering-gap policy.** The high-level constructs §19 lowers — pattern
  matching → `switch`, `?` propagation, comprehensions, combinator chains, `is`/
  `implies` — have **no 1:1 source line**. The map must point each generated line at
  the *nearest meaningful* source span and the policy for "nearest" must be written
  down, because it is exactly where stepping will feel wrong if left implicit. This
  is the real design content of the ADR.
- **The runtime library.** `emitter/runtime.ts` is **hand-written TS** the
  generated code imports. Its frames should map to *itself*, and stepping should
  **skip it** (`skipFiles` / `smartStep` in the launch config) so a user steps over
  capability machinery, not into it. Same for the generated worker glue
  (`workers_entry.rs`, `wrangler.rs` output).
- **Composition through the bundler.** §19 phase 8 bundles to "one or more Worker
  scripts with source maps." Per-file maps must **compose through** the
  `wrangler`/esbuild bundle step (the bundler rewrites positions and chains maps).
  Confirm the chain survives before relying on it — an open question below.

## Internal architecture

A `SourceMapBuilder` accumulating VLQ-encoded segments, fed by the writer: the
**output** line advances as `write_line` emits; the **input** span comes from the
lowering cursor that already holds the AST node. **One unstated data dependency,
load-bearing for slice 1's ADR:** `Span` is *byte offsets* (`bynk-syntax/src/span.rs`
— `{ start, end }`, half-open), but a source map needs *line + column* at the input
end. The resolver already exists — `span::line_col(source, offset)` in the same leaf,
shared by `bynk-render` and the emitter's assertion locations — so the gap is not
writing it but **getting the per-file source text (or a precomputed line-index) to
emit time**, which the emitter doesn't thread today. The builder consumes that
line-index to resolve each `Span` to (line, col). The minimal surface change is
`write_line` (and the handful of direct `push_str` sites that emit
statement-significant text) gaining an *optional source span*, and the builder
emitting the `.map` + trailer alongside each `ProjectOutput` file. **No
re-architecture** — the emitter stays string-append; it gains a position-tracking
sidecar and starts forwarding the span it already has. That is the whole shape:
"thread the span that's in hand to the writer, accumulate, emit a sibling."

## Slice decomposition (proposed) — all v0.67+

0. ✅ **The source-map contract ADR — landed.** Two doc-ADRs (like `lsp.md` slice 0 /
   ADR 0093): [0103](../decisions/0103-source-map-contract.md) fixes granularity (**line-level, spike-ratified**), placement
   (sibling `.map` + `sourceMappingURL`), the `names` policy, the **lowering-gap
   "nearest *enclosing statement*" rule**, the `skipFiles` boundary, and the
   emission-gating / release-`sourcesContent` confidentiality call; [0104](../decisions/0104-debug-launch-model.md) fixes the
   debug-launch model (reuse-not-build). So slices 1–4 implement against a settled
   format. **Not desk-work:** the granularity and nearest-span calls were *gated on a
   throwaway spike* (open question 2, now closed) — a `?`/`match` example compiled with
   the real emitter, hand-given a line-level map, and **stepped under the V8 inspector**;
   the lowered expansion coalesced monotonically (8→3, 13→6 stops), so the ADR ratifies
   an observed decision, not a guessed one. No production code, no version tag.
1. ✅ **Emit source maps — the foundation (v0.68).** A `SourceMapBuilder` records
   `(generated offset → source span)` checkpoints at statement, match-arm, and
   declaration boundaries (a position-tracking sidecar on the existing string-append
   emitter — no re-architecture); `write_output` writes the sibling `.ts.map` +
   `//# sourceMappingURL` trailer. Free-function bodies get full statement-level
   mapping; service/agent handler bodies (lowered via spliced local buffers) anchor at
   declaration granularity for now — a noted follow-on, correct per D2. **Decode goldens**
   assert the source↔generated pairs the spike fixed (the `?` guard → its `let`; each
   `match` arm → its arm). The trailer + map live only on the on-disk artefact, so the
   516 in-memory `.ts` goldens stay byte-identical — no churn. Realises ADR 0103.
2. ✅ **Node / test-runner debugging (v0.69).** `bynkc test --inspect` compiles a
   **debug build** and launches the emitted test entry under `node --inspect-brk`,
   printing the inspector URL; a breakpoint set in `.bynk` **binds and pauses** there,
   resolved through slice 1's maps. A spike (open question — the run-and-map mechanism)
   found the obstacles and settled them: `tsc → node .js` breaks the map chain, so the
   debug build emits **`.ts` import specifiers** and runs the `.ts` **directly** under
   Node's line-preserving type-stripping (Node ≥ 22.6) — slice 1's `.ts.map` applies to
   the running file, no chaining. Implemented as a first-class `ImportExt` toggle on
   `CompileOptions`; the `AssertionError` emit is now strip-clean; `bynkc test` routes
   through the map-aware writer. An automated, dependency-free **CDP proof** asserts the
   breakpoint round-trip on a real `node --inspect-brk` (skips on Node < 22.6).
   **Deferred (noted follow-ons):** breakpoints *inside* test bodies (and service/agent
   handler bodies) need the spliced-buffer offset-rebasing slice 1 deferred — production
   code reached through a test debugs today; and the one-click VS Code launch
   (`DebugConfigurationProvider`) is slice 4. Realises ADR 0104 D3.
3. ✅ **workerd / `wrangler dev` debugging (v0.71).** The headline UX. `bynk dev
   --inspect` serves with `wrangler dev`'s V8 inspector enabled and prints an
   inspector URL; a `.bynk` handler breakpoint **binds and pauses on a real request**,
   per-statement (v0.70). **The track's least-certain slice turned out nearly free** —
   the spike closed both open questions: `wrangler dev --inspector-port` exposes a
   discoverable CDP endpoint (attach **directly**; one gotcha — the inspector requires
   an `Origin` header), and `wrangler`/esbuild **composes** the emitted `.ts.map` into
   the worker bundle (no bynk-side bundling). So the slice is a thin `--inspect` flag
   (inject `--inspector-port` + print attach guidance), unit-tested arg-wiring, and a
   **wrangler-guarded CDP proof** that the breakpoint round-trips on a real worker
   (skips when `wrangler` is absent; the v0.70 decode goldens are the always-on map
   guard). `skipFiles` the runtime/glue is documented here, **wired by slice 4** (the
   debugger client owns the launch config). Realises ADR 0104 D3.
4. ✅ **Extension wiring — one-click debugging (v0.72). The pragmatic Phase 1 is
   complete.** The `vscode-bynk` surface: `package.json` `debuggers` (`bynk`) +
   `breakpoints` (language `bynk`) contributions; a `DebugConfigurationProvider` that
   resolves a `bynk` launch by shelling the `--inspect` CLI, parsing the inspector
   port, and handing off a delegated `pwa-node` *attach* (`resolveSourceMapLocations`,
   `skipFiles`/`stopOnEntry`/`outFiles`); a **Test Explorer Debug profile** beside Run
   (DECISION C — the gutter action for free, no bespoke CodeLens); `launch.json`
   snippets; and a `bynk.bynkPath` setting for the dev path. **Both runtimes ship**
   (DECISION B resolved): the spike confirmed VS Code's `pwa-node` attaches to
   `wrangler`'s inspector (the `Origin` header is js-debug's to send — a non-issue).
   **One prerequisite the spike surfaced and this slice folded in:** the emitter's map
   `sources` must be the `.bynk` files' **absolute** paths — an editor sets breakpoints
   by *file path* (the CLI scenarios set them by generated line, sidestepping this), and
   a project-relative `source` resolves against the emitted `.ts`'s directory, not the
   real file. Realises ADR 0104 D1/D2/D5. Integration-tested (Node path harness-provisioned;
   workerd path local/opt-in).
5. **Phase 2, part 1 — bynk-native debug *values* (v0.73).** ✅ for the value layer
   under Node. `Result`/`Option`/sum values now read in Bynk constructor syntax
   (`Ok(42)`, `Some("hi")`, `BadRequest("…")`, nested `Ok(Some(42))`) in hovers, the
   Variables pane, and Watch — via the **cheap variable-formatter path**: js-debug's
   `customDescriptionGenerator` injected into the slice-4 attach, no custom adapter,
   no runtime change (structural recognition of the emitted tagged shape). Behind a
   default-on `bynk.debug.semanticValues` toggle. **The spike split the runtimes:** it
   works on Node (`bynkc test --inspect`) and ships there; `workerd` rejects the
   in-debuggee evaluation (it breaks variable reading outright), so the dev path keeps
   the raw shape. Realises ADR 0104 D1 (the formatter half). **The Phase-2 remainder spun out to its
   own track — [`semantic-debugging.md`](semantic-debugging.md)** (ADR 0104 D1's
   custom-adapter half): workerd-vocabulary values, **contexts/actors as scopes**,
   **capability calls legible in the stack**, and **lowered-temp noise**. This
   debugging track **retires** once that track lands its remainder.

Each slice except 0 is an ordinary `vX.Y-<slug>.md` proposal citing this doc and
the foundational ADRs; merging that proposal authorises the build. Status tracked
here as slices land.

## Open questions to close in settle

- ✅ **`wrangler dev` inspector attachment — closed (slice-3 spike; v0.71).** Does it
  expose a stable, programmatically attachable inspector port? **Answer: yes — attach
  directly.** `wrangler dev --inspector-port <N>` serves a Chrome-DevTools-Protocol
  endpoint (`http://127.0.0.1:N/json` → `ws://…/ws`), confirmed against `wrangler`
  4.x. One gotcha: the inspector **requires an `Origin` header** on the WebSocket
  (`400 Bad Request` without it). So slice 3 attaches directly; the `bynk dev
  --inspect`-owned-proxy fallback was not needed.
- ✅ **Breakpoint fidelity on lowered constructs — closed (slice-0 spike).** Is
  line-level mapping with a documented "nearest span" rule acceptable for `match`/`?`/
  comprehensions, or does stepping feel wrong enough to force expression-level sooner?
  **Answer: line-level is sufficient.** The spike compiled a two-`?` + `match` example
  with the real emitter, hand-gave it a line-level map (every generated line anchored to
  its *enclosing source statement*), and stepped it under the V8 inspector. Lowering is
  contiguous and order-preserving, so the `?` guard and match `case`/binding lines
  coalesce into their statement's source line: 8 raw V8 stops → 3 source steps
  (`5 → 6 → 7`); 13 → 6 (`11 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 12 → 13`), monotonic. Ratified in [0103](../decisions/0103-source-map-contract.md) D1/D2;
  expression-level deferred until a construct is *shown* to step poorly.
- ✅ **Map composition through bundling — closed (slice-3 spike; v0.71).** Do per-file
  maps chain through the `wrangler`/esbuild bundle (§19 phase 8) so the attached
  session resolves to `.bynk`? **Answer: yes — esbuild composes them.** The worker
  bundle's `index.js.map` `sources` include the `.bynk` file (esbuild folds the emitted
  `handlers.ts.map` in), so a `.bynk` breakpoint binds and pauses on the running worker
  — confirmed by the wrangler-guarded CDP proof. No bynk-side bundling work, and no
  post-bundle-map fallback needed.

## On merge — each slice updates

The forward-looking claims here are contracts. On landing, each slice's PR updates,
in the same change:

1. **`bynk-design-notes.md` §19** — mark the source-map commitment *realised* once
   slice 1 lands (and phase 8's "source maps" line, once composition is confirmed).
2. **This track's *Decision log*** — a dated entry with the slice's ADR link(s) and
   the one-line decision.
3. **This track's *Phase* bullet and the *slice-decomposition* row** — marked ✅ with
   the version, so the doc never overstates what shipped.
4. **`bynk-tooling-roadmap.md`** — add/advance the debugging thread under §4; and
   **correct `tracks/lsp.md`'s survey line** ("Bynk has no debugger") once the base
   ships.
5. **Golden / fixture tests** — the map-decode goldens (slice 1) and the
   breakpoint-binds session tests (slices 2–3).

## Foundational ADRs — landed (slice 0)

- ✅ **[0103](../decisions/0103-source-map-contract.md) — the source-map contract.** Granularity (line-level, spike-ratified),
  placement (sibling `.map` + `sourceMappingURL`), `names`, the lowering-gap "nearest
  *enclosing statement*" rule, the `skipFiles` boundary, and **emission gating + release
  `sourcesContent` handling** (the source-confidentiality call). The one genuinely
  format-bearing decision; baked once, up front, so slice 1 implements rather than
  discovers it.
- ✅ **[0104](../decisions/0104-debug-launch-model.md) — the debug-launch model.** The reuse-not-build decision made binding: a
  `DebugConfigurationProvider`, no bespoke DAP in phase 1, targets **workerd + Node**,
  remote **deferred**. Fixes the launch surface and the deferral boundary so slices 2–4
  wire against a settled model.

## Decision log

_A dated entry per slice with its ADR link and the one-line decision, mirroring the
actors / LSP tracks._

- **2026-06-22 — slice 5 (v0.73). Phase 2 begins: bynk-native debug values.** *Values
  read in Bynk's vocabulary.* Realises [0104](../decisions/0104-debug-launch-model.md)
  D1's variable-formatter path: a `customDescriptionGenerator` (js-debug evaluates it in
  the debuggee) injected into slice 4's attach renders the emitted tagged shape as Bynk
  constructor syntax — `Ok(42)`, `Some`/`None`, sum variants, nested. No custom adapter,
  no runtime change. Behind `bynk.debug.semanticValues` (default on). **Spike verdict —
  the runtimes split:** confirmed on Node (renders legibly, nests, structural `.tag`
  recognition with no false positives, so DECISION D's brand is unneeded); **`workerd`
  rejects the in-debuggee evaluation** ("Error processing variables: unreachable" — it
  breaks variable reading), so the dev path omits the generator and shows the raw shape.
  So DECISION A ships **Node-only**; workerd-vocabulary values join contexts/actors-as-
  scopes, capability-stack legibility, and lowered-temp-noise as the **custom-adapter**
  follow-ons (DECISION C) — Phase 2's remainder, likely its own track.
- **2026-06-22 — slice 4 (v0.72). The pragmatic Phase 1 is complete.** *One-click
  debugging in VS Code.* Realises [0104](../decisions/0104-debug-launch-model.md)
  D1/D2/D5. The `vscode-bynk` extension contributes a `bynk` debug type whose
  `DebugConfigurationProvider` shells the `--inspect` CLIs, parses the inspector port,
  and delegates to a `pwa-node` *attach* — glue, no Debug Adapter. A Test Explorer
  **Debug** profile is the headline entry (DECISION C); a `launch.json` config debugs
  the dev worker. **DECISION B resolved — both runtimes ship:** the spike confirmed
  `pwa-node` attaches to `wrangler`'s inspector (the `Origin` header is js-debug's to
  send, a non-issue). **Prerequisite surfaced by the spike and folded in:** the emitter
  map `sources` are now the `.bynk` files' **absolute** paths — an editor matches
  breakpoints by file path (the CLI scenarios matched by generated line and never hit
  this), and a relative `source` resolves against the emitted `.ts`'s dir, not the real
  file. Easily migratable to a portable scheme later (it's one path-computation site).
  Integration-tested end-to-end through the real provider (Node harness-provisioned;
  workerd local/opt-in). Phase 2 (the bynk-native semantic value layer) remains
  named-not-scheduled, likely its own track.
- **2026-06-22 — slice 3 (v0.71).** *workerd / `wrangler dev` debugging.* Realises
  [0104](../decisions/0104-debug-launch-model.md) D3. `bynk dev --inspect` serves with
  `wrangler dev`'s V8 inspector; a `.bynk` handler breakpoint binds + pauses on a real
  request, per-statement. **Both open questions closed by the spike:** the inspector
  port is directly attachable (`--inspector-port`; needs an `Origin` header), and
  esbuild composes the emitted `.ts.map` into the worker bundle (resolves to `.bynk`).
  So the slice is thin — a `--inspect` flag + a wrangler-guarded CDP proof. `skipFiles`
  is documented; wiring it is slice 4.
- **2026-06-22 — spliced-body source maps (v0.70).** *The deferred follow-on from
  slices 1–2, discharged.* Realises [0103](../decisions/0103-source-map-contract.md)
  fully: service/agent/provider handler bodies and test-case bodies — which lower
  through a spliced local buffer — now map **per-statement**, not to the enclosing
  declaration. The `SourceMapBuilder` gains a **line-anchored `merge`** (rebases a
  body's checkpoints at the splice, correct for both verbatim and indented splices)
  and **multi-source** maps (a test group spans several `.bynk` files; test modules
  stop returning no map). No emitted-TS change. **Discovered by the slice-3 spike**
  (worker handler breakpoints collapsed to the `service` line); this unblocks slice
  3's per-statement workerd granularity and slice 2's in-test-body breakpoints. Mock
  op bodies remain unmapped (scaffolding — a deliberate cut).
- **2026-06-21 — slice 2 (v0.69).** *Node / test-runner debugging.* Realises
  [0104](../decisions/0104-debug-launch-model.md) D3. `bynkc test --inspect` runs the
  emitted test entry under `node --inspect-brk` and a `.bynk` breakpoint binds + pauses
  via slice 1's maps. **Ratified by spike:** the run-and-map mechanism — run the `.ts`
  directly under line-preserving type-stripping (`.ts` specifiers + strip-clean emit),
  *not* `tsc → .js` (which breaks the map chain). Built as a first-class `ImportExt`
  toggle on `CompileOptions`; map-aware test writer; an automated CDP breakpoint-binds
  proof. **Deferred:** test-body / handler-body maps (shared spliced-buffer rebasing) and
  the VS Code `DebugConfigurationProvider` (slice 4) — production-code breakpoints reached
  through a test work today.
- **2026-06-21 — slice 1 (v0.68).** *Emit source maps — the foundation.* Realises
  [0103](../decisions/0103-source-map-contract.md). A `SourceMapBuilder` threads the
  spans the AST already carries to a sibling `.ts.map` (v3) + `//# sourceMappingURL`
  trailer written by `write_output`; checkpoints at statement / match-arm / declaration
  boundaries give line-level, nearest-enclosing mapping (D2). Free-function bodies map
  at statement granularity; service/agent handler bodies (spliced local buffers) anchor
  at declaration granularity — a noted follow-on. Decode goldens pin the `?`/`match`
  pairs the spike fixed; the trailer/map are on-disk only, so all 516 `.ts` goldens stay
  byte-identical. The §19 *debugger* commitment is now realised; the production
  bundled-map / stack-trace half (phase 8) remains open (slice 3+).
- **2026-06-21 — slice 0 (settle).** Foundational ADRs [0103](../decisions/0103-source-map-contract.md) (source-map contract)
  and [0104](../decisions/0104-debug-launch-model.md) (debug-launch model) accepted. **Decision:** line-level,
  statement-anchored source maps emitted as siblings by `bynk-emit`; the lowering-gap
  rule anchors every generated line to its enclosing source statement; reuse VS Code's
  JS debugger via a thin `DebugConfigurationProvider`, no bespoke DAP in phase 1.
  **Ratified by spike:** a `?`/`match` example, compiled with the real emitter and
  stepped under the V8 inspector, coalesced 8→3 and 13→6 raw stops into monotonic
  source steps — line-level is sufficient, expression-level deferred. The
  source-confidentiality call ([0103](../decisions/0103-source-map-contract.md) D6): `sourcesContent` and bundle-chaining are
  profile-gated so `.bynk` source never reaches a deployed Worker by default.
