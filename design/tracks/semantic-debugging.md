# Tooling track — Semantic debugging: make the debugger speak Bynk

- **Phase:** 🔴 **Drafted — slice 0 (settle) next.** No production code yet, and
  unlike the debugging track this one's foundation is **genuinely uncertain**: the
  load-bearing question is *whether we can interpose on VS Code's JavaScript
  debugger to rewrite what it reports*, and at what cost. Slice 0 spikes that and
  lands the model ADR before anything is built.
- **Continues:** the [debugging track](debugging.md)'s **Phase 2**. Phase 1 (slices
  0–4, v0.67–v0.72) put real breakpoints, stepping, and the call stack onto `.bynk`
  source by *reusing* js-debug — "wiring, not a Debug Adapter." Phase 2 slice 5
  (v0.73) shipped the cheap, runtime-side half of the semantic layer — **value
  descriptions** (`Ok(42)`) — via js-debug's `customDescriptionGenerator`. That
  mechanism went as far as it can; **everything left needs the debugger to report
  *differently*, not just *describe* differently**, which the cheap path can't do.
  This track owns that remainder.
- **Realises:** ADR [0104](../decisions/0104-debug-launch-model.md) **D1** — "a
  custom adapter (or a variable-formatter contribution) is the *only* place the
  deferred bynk-native semantic layer might earn its keep — showing `Result`/
  `Option`/sum values unwrapped, **contexts/actors as scopes**, **capability calls
  legible in the stack**." Slice 5 took the variable-formatter half; this track
  takes the **custom-adapter** half D1 named, for the asks the formatter can't reach.
- **Depends on / sequences after:** the debugging track's launch surface (the
  `bynk` debug type + `DebugConfigurationProvider`, `vscode-bynk/src/debug.ts`) and
  its source maps (`bynk-emit`). This track interposes *on top of* that session — it
  does not replace the attach. **Refreshes** `bynk-tooling-roadmap.md` (the debugging
  thread under §4).

## Why a track and not a single proposal

ADR 0076 triggers, squarely:

- **Unavoidably multi-increment, sharing one artefact.** Value rewriting for both
  runtimes, scopes-as-actors, stack legibility, and temp-noise suppression are
  separate slices that all flow through **one interposition layer** — the thing
  that sits in the DAP stream and transforms js-debug's responses. The layer is the
  shared contract; each slice adds a transform.
- **Hard-to-reverse, and genuinely risky infrastructure.** The interposition
  mechanism (below) is an architectural commitment every later slice inherits, and
  its feasibility is *not yet known* — the opposite of Phase 1, where the throughline
  was "wiring data we already produce." A delete-on-merge proposal would bet the
  whole semantic layer on an unspiked mechanism and discard the reasoning the later
  reshapes need.

It is a **tooling track** (like `lsp.md`, `debugging.md`) — no language surface, no
threat model — but the multi-increment, shared-and-uncertain-foundation shape is the
ADR 0076 case.

## The throughline — and the one hard capability

> **Every remaining ask reduces to: rewrite what the debugger *reports* — the
> `variables`, `scopes`, and `stackTrace` it sends to the UI — into Bynk's
> vocabulary, on the *editor* side, so it is runtime-agnostic.** Slice 5's generator
> ran *in the debuggee* (and so died on workerd, which forbids the evaluation). The
> editor-side rewrite has no such limit: it transforms js-debug's response after the
> fact, the same for Node and workerd. The hard part is **getting into that stream

> session (`DebugAdapterTracker`) is *observe-only*. That gap is this track's load-
> bearing risk, and slice 0's spike.

Grounded in the Phase-1/slice-5 reality, confirmed by reading the code:

- The `bynk` session today is a **delegated `pwa-node` attach**: the provider's
  `resolveDebugConfiguration` returns a `type: "node"` config and js-debug runs it
  (`vscode-bynk/src/debug.ts`). We never see its DAP traffic with intent to change it.
- A `DebugAdapterTracker` (which slice 4's entry-resume and the slice-5 spikes use)
  receives `onWillReceiveMessage`/`onDidSendMessage` but is **documented as a
  tracker** — observation, not mutation.
- Bynk values are **uniform tagged objects** (`{ tag: "Ok", value }`, `bynk-emit`'s
  runtime) — recognisable structurally, no metadata needed (slice 5 proved this).
  Compiler temps already carry a **`__`-prefix convention** (`__r0`, `__d` from the
  `?`/`match` lowering) — also recognisable. Capability handles arrive as a `deps`
  object (`http_GET(deps: { Logger })`). So *some* reshapes are inferable from shape
  and naming; the richer ones (frame → capability, context → scope) may want emitter
  **debug-metadata**, decided per slice, not up front.

## The interposition ladder — slice 0's spike

The mechanism is unknown, so slice 0 climbs a **cheap-to-expensive ladder** and
stops at the first rung that works, exactly as Phase 1 spiked the cheap path first:

1. **Tracker mutation (cheapest).** Does mutating the message object in a
   `DebugAdapterTracker.onDidSendMessage` actually change what the UI renders? It's
   undocumented, possibly fragile — but if VS Code forwards the same object, a
   one-file rewrite layer drops in with zero session-wrapping. *Spike this first.*
2. **A wrapping proxy adapter (the real custom adapter).** Register a
   `DebugAdapterDescriptorFactory` for the `bynk` type whose adapter forwards DAP to
   js-debug underneath and rewrites `variables`/`scopes`/`stackTrace` responses
   (tracking `variablesReference` for lazy children). This is ADR 0104 D1's "thin
   custom adapter that wraps the JS debugger" — full control, but it must drive
   js-debug as a sub-adapter without breaking its child-session/CDP machinery.
3. **Bespoke DAP-over-CDP (last resort).** Only if wrapping js-debug proves
   intractable. ADR 0104 D1 deliberately avoided this in Phase 1; rebuilding
   breakpoints/stepping/source-maps is the expensive thing — named here only so the
   ladder is honest, not as a plan.

Slice 0 settles which rung, in **ADR 0105 (the semantic-debugging adapter model)**,
and the transform contract (what each rewrite does, the inference-vs-metadata line)
in **ADR 0106** if the spike shows it needs pinning.

## Slice decomposition

0. **Settle.** Spike the ladder (rung 1 → 2); land ADR 0105 (interposition model)
   and, if needed, ADR 0106 (transform contract + the emitter-metadata boundary). No
   production code until a rung is observed to work — the make-or-break slice.
1. **Values through the interposer — *both* runtimes.** Re-deliver Bynk value
   rendering via the chosen interposition, on the editor side, so it works under
   **workerd** too (closing the gap slice 5 couldn't). Retire or keep the slice-5
   generator for Node as the spike advises. The first real payoff and the proof the
   mechanism carries weight; structural recognition, no emitter change.
2. **Contexts/actors as scopes.** Reshape `scopes`/`variables` so a handler's frame
   reads in Bynk structure — capability handles (the `deps` object) as a
   *capabilities* group, the `by` actor/visitor surfaced, agent state as its own
   scope — instead of a flat JS local list. First candidate to need emitter
   debug-metadata; inference-first, metadata only where shape won't tell.
3. **Capability calls legible in the stack.** Reshape `stackTrace`: a frame that is a
   capability invocation reads as the Bynk operation; toolchain/glue frames collapse
   (the semantic complement to Phase 1's `skipFiles`, which hides *files* but not the
   *labels* of frames that remain).
4. **Quiet the lowered-temp noise.** Hide or group the compiler temporaries
   (`__r0`, `__d`, the `?`/`match` spill bindings) in the Variables pane, so stepping
   shows the user's bindings, not the lowering's. Partly an **emitter** slice —
   formalise the temp-naming convention the interposer keys on.

Each slice (except 0) is an ordinary `vX.Y-<slug>.md` proposal citing this doc and
ADR 0105; merging it authorises the build. Status tracked here as slices land.

## Open questions to close in settle

- **Can a `DebugAdapterTracker` mutate responses?** (Ladder rung 1.) If yes, the whole
  track gets dramatically cheaper. *Spike — the single highest-leverage unknown.*
- **Can a proxy adapter wrap js-debug without breaking it?** (Rung 2.) js-debug spawns
  child sessions (per worker/subprocess) and owns the CDP connection; a proxy must
  relay DAP and rewrite responses while leaving that intact. Confirm before committing.
- **`variablesReference` lifecycle.** Rewriting a `variables` response means owning the
  reference graph for lazily-expanded children — the rewrite must be stable across
  expand requests, not just the top frame. Establish the bookkeeping in slice 0/1.
- **Inference vs emitter metadata.** How far do shape (`tag`, `deps`) and naming
  (`__`-temps) carry the reshapes before a debug-metadata sidecar earns its cost?
  Draw the line per slice; keep the emitter untouched where inference suffices.
- **Does the interposer compose with slice 4's provider hand-off?** The `bynk` type
  resolves to a `type: "node"` config today; rungs 1 and 2 attach to that differently.
  Settle how the interposition binds to the delegated session.

## On merge — each slice updates

1. **This track's *Phase* bullet and the *slice-decomposition* row** — ✅ with the
   version, so the doc never overstates what shipped.
2. **This track's *Decision log*** — a dated entry with the slice's ADR link(s) and
   the one-line decision (mirroring the debugging / actors / LSP tracks).
3. **The [debugging track](debugging.md)** — advance its Phase-2 "still open" list as
   each remainder ask lands here.
4. **`bynk-tooling-roadmap.md`** — advance the debugging thread under §4.
5. **Tests** — the session-level rewrite tests (does a `Result` read `Ok(42)` on
   workerd; does a handler frame show a *capabilities* scope), guarded like the
   debugging track's workerd tests (local/opt-in; CI has no `wrangler`).

## Foundational ADRs — to land in slice 0

- 🔜 **0105 — the semantic-debugging adapter model.** Which interposition rung
  (tracker-mutation / wrapping proxy / bespoke), how it binds to the delegated
  js-debug session, and the runtime-agnostic editor-side-rewrite principle. The
  make-or-break, hard-to-reverse decision — baked up front so slices 1–4 implement
  rather than rediscover it.
- 🔜 **0106 (if needed) — the transform contract.** What each rewrite produces
  (values, scopes-as-actors, stack labels, temp suppression) and the
  inference-vs-debug-metadata boundary. Split out only if the spike shows the
  contract needs pinning before slice 1.

## Decision log

_A dated entry per slice with its ADR link and the one-line decision._

- **2026-06-22 — track drafted.** Spun out of the [debugging track](debugging.md)'s
  Phase 2 after slice 5 (v0.73) shipped value descriptions via the cheap
  `customDescriptionGenerator` and the spike proved that mechanism **(a)** can't reach
  workerd (the runtime forbids in-debuggee evaluation) and **(b)** can only *describe*,
  not *reshape* (`scopes`/`stackTrace` are out of its reach). The remainder —
  workerd-vocabulary values, contexts/actors as scopes, capability-stack legibility,
  lowered-temp noise — all need editor-side response rewriting, a different and
  riskier mechanism (ADR 0104 D1's custom-adapter half). Hence its own track, settle-
  first: slice 0 spikes the interposition ladder and lands ADR 0105 before any build.
