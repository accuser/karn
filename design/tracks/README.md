# Feature tracks

Persistent design docs for **far-reaching, multi-increment language features** —
the artefact introduced by [ADR 0076](../decisions/0076-feature-track-posture.md).

A feature track applies when a feature has two or more of: it spans several
increments, its surface is not yet settled, or it is a security/safety boundary.
For everything else, the standard single-increment
[proposal](../proposals/README.md) still applies.

## What a track doc is — and isn't

- **Persistent, not transient.** Unlike a proposal (deleted by the PR that
  implements it), a track doc lives for the whole feature: it is the living map
  the per-slice proposals are cut from, updated as each slice lands, retired only
  when the theme completes.
- **A realisation of the design notes, not a replacement.** It sharpens the
  conceptual commitment in `../bynk-design-notes.md` into a concrete surface,
  an internal architecture, a security/threat model, and an ordered slice
  decomposition. The design notes stay the north star.
- **Not a build authorisation.** Merging a track doc settles *direction*. Each
  slice is still an ordinary `vX.Y-<slug>.md` proposal under `../proposals/`,
  citing this doc and the foundational ADRs; *merging that proposal* is the
  approval to build, per `../proposals/README.md`.

## Lifecycle

1. **Settle.** Draft the doc; close its open design questions (investigation +
   prior art); land the load-bearing, hard-to-reverse **ADRs up front**.
2. **Slice.** Cut each increment as an ordinary proposal that cites the doc and
   the ADRs; build / land / delete as usual. Mark the slice done here.
3. **Retire.** When the last slice lands, the doc is removed (or archived); its
   decisions live on in the ADRs and the spec-in-place.

## Active tracks

- **`semantic-debugging.md`** — make the debugger *speak Bynk*: rewrite the
  `variables`/`scopes`/`stackTrace` it reports into Bynk's vocabulary on the editor
  side (workerd-vocabulary values, contexts/actors as scopes, capability-stack
  legibility, lowered-temp suppression). Continues the debugging track's **Phase 2**
  for the asks the cheap variable-formatter can't reach (ADR 0104 D1's custom-adapter
  half). Drafted — slice 0 (settle) next: spike the interposition mechanism, land
  ADR 0105.
- **`debugging.md`** — source-mapped step debugging. **Phase 1 complete** (slices
  0–4, v0.67–v0.72: breakpoints/stepping/stack on `.bynk` under Node + workerd) and
  **Phase 2 begun** (slice 5, v0.73: value descriptions). Its Phase-2 remainder is
  carried by `semantic-debugging.md` above; this doc retires once that lands.

## Retired tracks

Per the lifecycle above (step 3), a completed track doc is removed once its
decisions live on in the ADRs and the spec-in-place. Retired so far:

- **`crate-decomposition.md`** — a tooling track: `bynkc` decomposed from a
  monolith into a layered library set
  (`bynk-syntax`/`-render`/`-fmt`/`-check`/`-emit`/`-ide`), the human CLI moving
  up into the driver. All slices shipped (v0.60–v0.66); decisions in ADRs
  [0099](../decisions/0099-crate-layering-dependency-direction.md)–[0102](../decisions/0102-foundation-types-boundary.md)
  (+ the 0084 amendment).
- **`actors.md`** — actor declarations as boundary contracts (the `actor`
  declaration, the `by` clause, authentication schemes, identity). Q1–Q7 shipped
  (v0.45–v0.54); decisions in ADRs
  [0080](../decisions/0080-actor-schemes-closed-nominal.md)–0082, 0085,
  0088–[0092](../decisions/0092-cross-context-caller-value.md). The inaugural
  feature track. Q8 (replay/ordering) deferred to a future Events track —
  [issue #260](https://github.com/accuser/bynk/issues/260).
- **`lsp.md`** — the editor-experience connective plan (completion overhaul,
  navigation round-out, editor polish). Slices 0–7 + 9 shipped (v0.24–);
  decisions in ADRs
  [0093](../decisions/0093-completion-surface-contract.md)–[0095](../decisions/0095-unit-source-map.md),
  with the feature spec in [`../bynk-lsp-spec.md`](../bynk-lsp-spec.md). Remaining
  work tracked in issues
