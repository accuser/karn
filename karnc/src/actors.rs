//! v0.45 actor contracts (the actors-foundations slice).
//!
//! An `actor` declaration is a nominal *boundary contract* (ADR Q1): a closed,
//! compiler-known authentication `Scheme` plus an optional sealed identity. A
//! handler consumes an actor on its `by` clause; the boundary verifies the
//! scheme and mints the identity before the body runs (two-phase, fail-closed —
//! ADR Q5/Q2).
//!
//! This module holds the compiler-known parts: the closed scheme set, the
//! prelude actors, the per-protocol default actors, and the admissible-scheme
//! sets. Foundations admits only the two zero-crypto schemes (`None`,
//! `Internal`); `Bearer`/`Signature` are reserved-and-rejected.
