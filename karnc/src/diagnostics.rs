//! Central registry of diagnostic codes.
//!
//! This is the single source of truth for the `karn.*` codes the compiler can
//! emit. The reference page `docs/src/reference/diagnostics.md` is generated
//! from [`render_markdown`], and the test `tests/diagnostics_registry.rs`
//! asserts that this table matches exactly the set of codes used across the
//! compiler source — so a new code cannot be introduced without documenting it
//! here, and a removed code cannot linger in the docs.
//!
//! Each entry is a `(code, summary)` pair. The category shown in the generated
//! reference is derived from the second dotted segment of the code.

/// One documented diagnostic: its stable code and a one-line summary of the
/// cause. Richer "cause and fix" material for the common diagnostics lives in
/// the troubleshooting how-to guides.
