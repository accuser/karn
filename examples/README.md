# Bynk examples

A gallery of small, complete Bynk projects. Each one type-checks, compiles to a
standard Cloudflare Worker, runs locally under `wrangler dev`, and deploys with
`wrangler deploy` — from the same source.

Start with **[`hello-world`](hello-world/)** (a greeter — refined types, a
capability, typed HTTP, a test). The rest each lead with a different part of the
language; the middle four lead with the **agent storage kinds** (`Map`, `Cache`,
`Log`) and the **`Query[T]`** vocabulary.

| Example | Leads with | Entry points | Capabilities | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`hello-world`](hello-world/) | refined types, capabilities, typed HTTP | http | `Logger` | greeting + `Subject` boundary |
| [`link-shortener`](link-shortener/) | KV persistence with TTL, random ids | http | `Random`, `Kv` | `Slug`/`Url` boundary + key helper |
| [`feature-flags`](feature-flags/) | public vs. authorised routes, KV listing | http | `Kv` | `FlagKey` boundary + key round-trip |
| [`todo`](todo/) | an agent keyed by the caller's identity; a storage `Map` + `Query[T]` | http | — | the agent (add / complete / `pendingCount`) |
| [`orders`](orders/) | storage `Map`s, `@indexed`, and `Query[T]` joins / groups / aggregates | http | — | the joins, groups, and aggregates |
| [`sessions`](sessions/) | a `Cache` with `@ttl` per-entry expiry | http | `Clock` | — (platform clock; see below) |
| [`event-log`](event-log/) | a `Log` with `@retain` + time-window queries | http | `Clock` | — (platform clock; see below) |
| [`rate-limiter`](rate-limiter/) | the agent model (one Durable Object per key) | http | `Clock` | the fixed-window policy |
| [`uptime-monitor`](uptime-monitor/) | scheduled work that calls the outside world | cron + http | `Fetch`, `Kv`, `Logger` | the health policy + key helper |
| [`webhook-relay`](webhook-relay/) | verifying a signed webhook, then forwarding it | http | `Fetch`, `Logger`, `Secrets` | — (all-effectful; see below) |

Together they cover every entry point (http, cron; queue is covered in the
[queue guide](https://bynk-lang.org/book/guides/entry-points/queue/)), both state models — **KV
binding storage** and **Durable-Object agents** — and the full agent storage-kind
catalogue: a `Cell` (`rate-limiter`, `todo`), a `Map` (`todo`, `orders`), a
`Cache` (`sessions`), and a `Log` (`event-log`). The `Query[T]` vocabulary appears
both lazily over storage and eagerly over a `List`: `filter`/`sortBy`/`collect`,
the aggregates `count`/`sum`, the joins `joinOn`/`leftJoin`, and `groupBy`
(`orders`), plus the storage annotations `@indexed`/`@ttl`/`@retain` and the
`Instant`/`Duration` time primitives (`sessions`, `event-log`). They also cover
every actor scheme (`Visitor`, `Bearer`, an authorisation refinement, `Signature`)
and the outbound-`Fetch` + JSON-codec story.

## The shared workflow

From any example directory, one command builds and serves it locally:

```sh
bynk dev          # compile + serve on http://localhost:8787 (local mode)
```

That's the compile-and-run recipe in one step — it runs `wrangler dev` in local
mode, so KV / Durable Objects / queues are simulated and there's nothing to
provision. The manual equivalent it runs under the hood:

```sh
bynkc check src                                   # type-check, no output
bynkc compile src --output out --target workers   # emit a Worker
cd out/workers/<name> && npx wrangler dev         # run it locally
```

`bynkc` lives at `target/release/bynkc` after `cargo build --release -p bynkc`
(see the [install page](https://bynk-lang.org/book/introduction/install/)). The generated
`wrangler.toml` carries the bindings each example needs — a `[[kv_namespaces]]`
stanza, `[[durable_objects.bindings]]`, or `crons` — with placeholder ids to fill
in at deploy time.

To run an example's tests:

```sh
bynkc test .      # from the example directory
```

Seven of the ten examples ship tests. Each factors its testable logic — a refined
type's boundary, a key helper, a windowing or health policy, or a
capability-free agent — into a unit that runs without any platform binding (see
*Notes* below for where the line is drawn).

## Notes on the current language surface

These examples are honest about what compiles *today* (Bynk is pre-1.0):

- **Capabilities (`given`) live on handlers, not on free functions.** Effectful
  work stays inside service/agent handlers; only pure helpers are factored out
  (see `uptime-monitor`, `event-log`).
- **Storage `Query[T]` terminals return an `Effect`; the same vocabulary is eager
  over a `List`.** `orders` runs `joinOn`/`groupBy`/`sum` lazily over storage maps
  inside the agent; `event-log` runs the *same* `groupBy` eagerly over a `List` in
  `commons digest`. A test asserts on **scalar** handler results (a `count`/`sum`
  aggregate, a record, a `Result`) rather than on a returned `List`, because a
  `List` terminal in a test needs a typed receiver the test harness does not yet
  track — so `orders` and `todo` test through their aggregate handlers.
- **A test can target a `commons`, a capability-free agent, a user-declared
  `capability`, or a consumed *context*** — substitutable in a `test` block with
  `mocks`. What a test **cannot** target today is a context that itself
  `consumes bynk { … }`: a *platform* capability has no in-test substitute, and
  merely declaring one breaks the whole context's test emission
  ([#291](https://github.com/accuser/bynk/issues/291)). So a testable example
  keeps its logic — a refined type's boundary, a key helper, a policy, or a
  capability-free agent (as in `todo` and `orders`) — out of any platform-touching
  context.

  **Three examples therefore ship no test**, each because its boundary work is
  platform-effectful with no in-test stand-in: `webhook-relay` (HMAC verify →
  `Fetch` → `Secrets`), and `sessions` / `event-log` (their `Cache` / `Log` stamp
  the platform `Clock`). Their pure pieces are still type-checked by `bynkc check`,
  and their behaviour is exercised end to end under `bynk dev`.
