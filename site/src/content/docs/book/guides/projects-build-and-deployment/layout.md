title: Lay out a project
---
**Goal:** structure a multi-file project with source and tests, and build it.

A project is a directory containing a `bynk.toml` manifest and your `.bynk`
files. The conventional layout keeps source and tests in sibling trees:

```text
my-project/
├── bynk.toml
├── src/
│   ├── counters.bynk       # context counters
│   └── quantities.bynk     # commons quantities
└── tests/
    ├── counters.bynk       # suite counters
    └── quantities.bynk     # suite quantities
```

This is convention, not a rule. **Test-ness is structural** — a `suite` block is
a test wherever it lives — so you can put tests beside the code they exercise, or
even in the *same file*:

```bynk
-- src/quantities.bynk — an atomic file: the commons and its tests together
commons quantities {
  fn double(n: Int) -> Int { n + n }
}

suite quantities {
  case "doubles" { expect double(3) == 6 }
}
```

When you build, the `suite` is **stripped** — never type-checked for the build,
never emitted to the deployable — while `bynkc test` compiles and runs it. There
is no `.test.bynk` suffix: every file is just `.bynk`, and the `suite` keyword is
what marks a test.

## The manifest

`bynk.toml` names the project. Layout config is optional:

```toml
[project]
name = "my-project"
version = "0.1.0"

[paths]
# Both keys are optional. `include` defaults to the conventional roots that
# exist (`src`, and `tests` when present), or the project root itself — so a
# conventional or a flat project needs no `[paths]` at all.
exclude = ["vendor"]   # skip subtrees (monorepo, vendored, generated .bynk)
```

See the [`bynk.toml` reference](/docs/manifest/) for every key. The tool always
skips its own `out/` and `node_modules/` caches and dot-directories.

## Path identity

A **source** unit's path must match its qualified name. A file declaring
`context counters` must be `counters.bynk`; one declaring `context commerce.orders`
must be `commerce/orders.bynk` (under an `include` root). A **`suite`** has no such
requirement — it names its target, so it is legal in any file.

> Source mismatches are reported as `bynk.project.inconsistent_commons_name`.

## Build and test

```sh
bynkc compile . --output out      # compile the project (suites stripped)
bynkc test .                      # compile and run the tests
bynkc check .                     # type-check only
```
