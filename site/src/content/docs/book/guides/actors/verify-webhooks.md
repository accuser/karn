title: Verify an inbound webhook
---
**Goal:** accept a webhook (from Stripe, GitHub, a sibling system) only when its
signature proves it came from the trusted sender — and reject replays.

A webhook is authenticated not by a token but by a **signature over the request
body**: the sender computes an HMAC of the raw body with a shared secret, and you
recompute and compare it. A `Signature` actor makes the compiler emit that check.

## A signed webhook

```bynk
context hooks

type Event = { id: String }

actor Webhook {
  auth = Signature(secret = "WEBHOOK_SECRET", header = "X-Signature")
}

service api from http {
  on POST("/hooks/event") by Webhook (body: Event) -> Effect[HttpResult[String]] {
    Ok("received")
  }
}
```

Before the body runs, the boundary reads the raw request body **once**,
recomputes HMAC-SHA256 over those exact bytes (WebCrypto, constant-time), and
compares it against the configured header — accepting a bare hex digest or a
`sha256=<hex>` prefix (the GitHub shape). Any mismatch, or a missing/malformed
header, **fails closed with `401`**; only then is the `body` parsed, from the
same bytes. There is no app-written HMAC, and no re-serialisation to get the
bytes wrong.

A `Signature` actor:
- attests **authenticity, not a principal** — it has no `identity`, so the
  binder is always omitted (`by Webhook`);
- **must take a `body`** — the signature is over the body, so a bodyless signed
  request is meaningless;
- is **HTTP-only**.

## Reject replays with a signed timestamp

Webhooks retry, so a captured request can be replayed. When the sender signs a
timestamp, configure a `timestamp` header and a `tolerance` (in seconds):

```bynk
context hooks

type Event = { id: String }

actor Webhook {
  auth = Signature(
    secret = "WEBHOOK_SECRET",
    header = "X-Signature",
    timestamp = "X-Timestamp",
    tolerance = 300
  )
}

service api from http {
  on POST("/hooks/event") by Webhook (body: Event) -> Effect[HttpResult[String]] {
    Ok("received")
  }
}
```

Now the signed string is `<timestamp>.<body>`, and the boundary additionally
rejects (fail-closed) a request whose timestamp is not a finite number within
`tolerance` seconds of now — a five-minute replay window here. A `tolerance`
without a `timestamp` is a compile error.

The replay window *bounds* replay; it does not *eliminate* it. Full event
deduplication (by event id) is the job of an idempotency capability — out of
scope here.
