[bynk.types.is_base_mismatch] `is Quantity` checks an `Int` value, but got `String`
```

## What it means

`value is RefinedType` narrows a value to a refined type by checking its
predicates at runtime. That only makes sense when the value's type matches the
refined type's **base** — you cannot check a `String` against an `Int`-based
refinement.

```bynk
type Quantity = Int where InRange(1, 100)

fn f(s: String) -> Bool {
  s is Quantity        -- Quantity is Int-based; s is a String
}
```

## Fix

Check the value against a refined type of its own base type, or convert first:

- For an `Int` value, use an `Int`-based refined type (`Quantity = Int where …`).
- For a `String` value, use a `String`-based one (`Code = String where …`).
