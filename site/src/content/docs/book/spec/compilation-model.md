title: "§8 Compilation model"
---
This chapter defines how Bynk sources are organised into a project, how a unit's
name relates to its file, and the pipeline that turns sources into type-correct
TypeScript. Emission itself — what each construct compiles to — is
[§7](/book/spec/emission/).

## §8.1 The manifest

A `bynk.toml` file at a directory's root marks it as a **project** and configures
its layout. Its keys:

| Table | Key | Controls |
|---|---|---|
| `[project]` | `name`, `version` | the project's name and version |
| `[paths]` | `src` | the directory holding source units |
| | `tests` | the directory holding test units |
| | `out` | the default output directory |
| `[fmt]` | `indent`, `max_line_width` | formatter settings (consumed by `bynkc fmt`) |
| `[lsp]` | `diagnostics_mode` | language-server settings |

## §8.2 Project and legacy modes

Bynk compiles in one of two modes.

**Project mode** — a `bynk.toml` is present. Source units live under `[paths].src`
and test units under `[paths].tests`. This is the mode that supports a
`src`/`tests` split and `bynkc test`.

**Legacy mode** — no manifest. A single `.bynk` file compiles as one standalone
unit. The project-only features — the `src`/`tests` split and `bynkc test` —
require project mode.

## §8.3 Source layout

In project mode a unit's file path MUST mirror its qualified name. A
`context commerce.orders` MUST live at `src/commerce/orders.bynk`, and a
`test commerce.orders` at `tests/commerce/orders.bynk`. A path that does not match
the declared name is rejected (`bynk.project.inconsistent_commons_name`,
`bynk.project.inconsistent_test_path`), as is a name declared as both a `commons`
and a `context` (`bynk.project.kind_conflict`). The source tree therefore mirrors
the program's architecture.

## §8.4 Build pipeline & conformance to TypeScript

A build runs the pipeline **lex → parse → resolve → check → emit**. The first four
stages establish well-formedness ([§3](/book/spec/lexical-grammar/)–[§5](/book/spec/static-semantics/));
only a well-formed program reaches emission ([§7](/book/spec/emission/)).

Emission writes, into the output directory, the per-context and per-test modules,
the composition root, the runtime library ([§7.4](/book/spec/runtime-library/)), and a
generated `tsconfig.json`. Every emitted module imports the runtime as
`./runtime.js` (or `../runtime.js` by directory depth). The `tsconfig.json`
enables `strict` and targets `ES2022` with `NodeNext` module resolution.

**First-party commons** (v0.20b). Alongside the injected first-party
*adapters* (the `bynk` surface and platform adapters,
[§7.3.6](/book/spec/emission/#736-adapters)), the toolchain ships first-party
*library* units inside the reserved `bynk.*` prefix: `bynk.list` and
`bynk.map`, ordinary commons **written in Bynk** over the collection kernel
([§5.10](/book/spec/static-semantics/#510-collections)). A project that
`uses bynk.list` (or `bynk.map`, which itself `uses bynk.list`) has the unit
injected as a synthetic source file ahead of grouping; it then flows through
the ordinary commons pipeline — tables, `uses` resolution, type-checking,
and emission to `bynk/list.ts` / `bynk/map.ts` beside the other modules.
Unconsumed, nothing is injected and the output is unchanged.

v0.22a adds `bynk.string` on the same path (`uses bynk.string` →
`bynk/string.ts`): derived helpers **written in Bynk over the string
kernel** ([§5.2](/book/spec/static-semantics/#52-well-typedness)) — currently
`join(parts: List[String], sep: String) -> String`. The kernel operations
themselves are compiler built-ins, not commons functions.

A successful Bynk build emits TypeScript that is **type-correct end to end**: it
compiles under `tsc --strict` with no errors. This is the final gate of the
compilation model — a Bynk program's well-formedness is realised, not merely
asserted, in a type-checked TypeScript program. `bynkc test` continues past this
gate, running the compiled, aggregated test runner on Node.

> [!NOTE]
> The detailed validation requirements a conforming build and test run MUST meet
> — that the emitted runtime and modules compile under `tsc --strict`, that
> refinement validation and agent-state lifecycle behave as specified, and that
> deliberate failures are reported — are part of conformance, specified in §10.
> This note is informative.

## §8.5 The platform axis

The deploy **platform** (`--platform`, values `cloudflare` — the default — and
`node`) is a selection axis **distinct from** the emit topology (`--target
{bundle,workers}`, [§7.2](/book/spec/emission/#72-targets)): the target chooses *how the
output is laid out*, the platform chooses *which host the ambient surface binds
to*. The platform selects the first-party `bynk` binding module linked into the
output (`bynk-cloudflare.ts` / `bynk-node.ts`,
[§7.3.6](/book/spec/emission/#736-adapters)). Because the `bynk` contract names canonical
provider symbols, changing platform changes only that one imported module;
porting Bynk to a new host means supplying this one binding.

As of v0.19 the axis also carries the **platform lock**: a deployment unit
whose closure reaches a platform-native capability MUST be built with the
matching `--platform`
([§5.8](/book/spec/static-semantics/#58-boundaries--cross-context)).

## §8.6 Binding modules & npm dependencies

An adapter's `binding "<module>"` path is resolved **relative to the adapter's
source file**; the module is copied verbatim into the output tree beside the
adapter's emitted module, so the composition root's import resolves and the
`tsc --strict` gate of §8.4 checks the binding's `implements` contract. The
union of all adapters' pinned `requires` entries
([§5.8](/book/spec/static-semantics/#58-boundaries--cross-context)) is emitted as the
`dependencies` map of a generated `package.json`; a project with no `requires`
emits none.
