title: Debug in VS Code
---
**Goal:** set a breakpoint in a `.bynk` file, press **Debug**, and step through
your code as it runs — under Node (tests) or `workerd` (the dev server).

The `vscode-bynk` extension delegates to VS Code's built-in JavaScript debugger:
it compiles your project, starts the V8 inspector, and attaches automatically.
Breakpoints set in `.bynk` sources resolve through the emitted source maps to the
exact statement, so you debug *Bynk*, not the generated TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

- The `vscode-bynk` extension installed (see [Set up editor
  support](/docs/editor-and-tooling/editor-support/)).
- `bynkc` and `bynk` on your `PATH` (or set `bynk.compilerPath` / `bynk.bynkPath`).
- **Node ≥ 22.6** for the test path (the emitted `.ts` runs under Node's
  type-stripping). For the dev-server path, the same toolchain
  [`bynk dev`](/docs/bynk-cli/#bynk-dev) needs (`wrangler`).

## Debug a test

1. Open a `.bynk` test file and click in the gutter to set a breakpoint — on a
   test-body statement, or in the production code the test exercises.
2. Run or debug it from the editor: each test shows a **`▷ Run Test | Debug Test`**
   CodeLens (and the native run/debug glyphs in the gutter) — click **Debug Test**.
   You can also use the **Testing** view's **Debug** action or profile.
3. The extension shells `bynkc test --inspect`, attaches, and execution pauses at
   your breakpoint. Step, inspect variables, and continue as usual.

The whole suite runs under the debugger; your breakpoint decides where it stops.
The Bynk runtime and generated glue are skip-stepped, so stepping stays inside
your code.

## Debug the dev server

1. Set a breakpoint in a `.bynk` handler (e.g. a `service`/`agent` request
   handler).
2. Create a `launch.json` (Run → Add Configuration → **Bynk**) — or use the
   snippet **Bynk: Debug dev server**:

   ```json
   {
     "type": "bynk",
     "request": "launch",
     "name": "Bynk: Debug dev server",
     "mode": "dev"
   }
   ```

3. Press **F5**. The extension runs `bynk dev --inspect`, attaches to
   `wrangler`'s inspector, and your handler **pauses on a real request** — send
   one (e.g. `curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/`) and step through it.

For a multi-context project, set `"context": "<name>"` to choose which worker to
serve and attach to. `"port"` overrides the inspector port (default `9229`).

## Values read in Bynk

When you inspect a value, the debugger shows it in Bynk's vocabulary rather than
its emitted shape — under **both** the test (Node) and dev-server (workerd) paths:

| You wrote | The debugger shows |
|---|---|
| `Ok(42)` | `Ok(42)` (not `{tag: "Ok", value: 42}`) |
| `Some("hi")` / `None` | `Some("hi")` / `None` |
| a sum variant | `BadRequest("…")` / `NotFound` |
| nested | `Ok(Some(42))` |

This applies to hovers, the Variables pane, and Watch. Turn it off with
**`bynk.debug.semanticValues: false`** to see the raw emitted shape.

> **A note on deeply-nested values.** On the **dev-server (workerd)** path the
> rendering is reconstructed from the debugger's value preview, which elides deep
> nesting — a nested value may show one level (`Ok(…)`) with the inner value one
> expand away (it renders in Bynk vocabulary too when you open it). The **test**
> path renders nesting fully inline.

## The handler frame in Bynk

Stopped inside a handler, the **Variables** pane groups the frame in Bynk's terms
rather than as a flat list of emitted locals: the capabilities a handler consumes
appear together under **`Capabilities`**, and an agent's state under **`State`** — both
sorted to the top, still expandable, with your own bindings and request parameters
listed below. Same toggle (`bynk.debug.semanticValues`).

The **Call Stack** reads in Bynk too: a handler frame is named for its **Bynk
operation** — `GET "/"`, `bump(amount)` — rather than the emitted function (`http_GET`),
while toolchain and runtime frames stay greyed out (skip-stepped). Clicking a frame
still navigates to its `.bynk` line.

The **compiler temporaries** the lowering spills (`__`-prefixed bindings from `?`/`match`)
are filtered out, so stepping shows your bindings rather than the lowering's. Turn the
whole thing off (`bynk.debug.semanticValues: false`) to see them and the raw shapes.

> Surfacing the `by` actor as part of the frame is a planned addition.

## How it works

Per ADR 0104 (the debug-launch model) this is *glue, not a Debug Adapter*: the
extension contributes a `bynk` debug type whose
configuration provider starts the inspector by shelling the
[`--inspect` CLIs](/docs/bynk-cli/) and hands off to VS Code's
JavaScript debugger (`pwa-node`). The source maps — `.bynk` files referenced by
absolute path so an editor breakpoint resolves to the same source the debugger
loads — do the breakpoint relocation. You can also run the CLIs directly and
attach any JavaScript debugger by hand; the one-click flow just automates that.

## Troubleshooting

- **The breakpoint shows as unbound (hollow).** Make sure the project is the
  open workspace folder — the debugger anchors source resolution there. Rebuild
  if the emitted output is stale.
- **`node` not found / wrong version.** The test path needs Node ≥ 22.6 for
  TypeScript type-stripping; check with `bynk doctor`.
- **Nothing happens on the dev path.** Confirm `wrangler` is available
  (`bynk doctor --only deploy`) and that a request actually reaches the handler.
