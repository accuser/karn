title: "`tree-sitter-bynk`"
---
The [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) grammar for Bynk.
It is the source of truth for structural tooling — syntax highlighting (the
playground's live editor, and any editor that speaks tree-sitter). The static
documentation site highlights its code blocks separately, via Expressive Code /
Shiki from the editor's TextMate grammar.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `grammar.js` | The grammar definition — the file you edit. |
| `src/parser.c`, `src/scanner.c` | Generated parser plus a hand-written external scanner (for `--- … ---` doc blocks). |
| `src/grammar.json`, `src/node-types.json` | Generated grammar metadata. |
| `queries/highlights.scm` | Highlight queries (the highlight groups). |
| `queries/injections.scm` | Language-injection queries (currently none). |
| `test/corpus/` | Versioned parse-tree test cases. |

The generated files in `src/` are committed. The book's
[grammar reference](/book/reference/grammar/) is generated from `src/grammar.json`.

## Build and test

With the [tree-sitter CLI](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/cli):

```sh
npm install          # once
npm run build        # tree-sitter generate  → regenerates src/
npm test             # tree-sitter test      → runs the corpus
```

After editing `grammar.js`, run `npm run build` to regenerate the parser, then
`npm test` to check it against the corpus. A corpus case is a named section: the
source, a `---` separator, and the expected S-expression parse tree.

## Highlight groups

`highlights.scm` maps grammar nodes to standard highlight groups — `@keyword`
(and `@keyword.declaration`, `.import`, `.modifier`, `.operator`), `@type`,
`@type.builtin`, `@string`, `@number`, `@comment`, `@function`, `@variable`,
`@operator`, `@punctuation.*`, and more. These groups drive the editor (VS Code
via `vscode-bynk`) and the playground's wasm tree-sitter highlighter, so
interactive highlighting stays correct as the grammar evolves. The static
documentation site highlights ```` ```bynk ```` blocks separately, via Expressive
Code / Shiki from the editor's TextMate grammar, so it is not driven by these
tree-sitter highlight groups.

## Keeping it in sync

`grammar.js` is regenerated to `src/` via `tree-sitter generate`; commit the
generated files together with the grammar change so downstream consumers (the
editors and the playground's highlighter) stay consistent.
